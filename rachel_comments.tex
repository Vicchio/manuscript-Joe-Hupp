% combined exp and comp discussion 

% too much focus on replication --> first and the Ni-Ni.. (1) Ni leaving is wrong --> therefore keep Ni fixed. 

% (2) None of the phase diagrams structure match well.. 

% (3) 12.. not lowest --> how much higher in energy.. what features does it contain? Karena and Woodrow should will leave.. high CN, bridging H2Os, 

% 12 is similar to 8..


% Introduction Comments

% mention that finding that a water bridge being present is a real possibily.. updating the hypothesis to include that water is present within. 

% Ending.. peak splitting of the Zr is now discussed at the end.. 

% conclusions can state the limitations

% 14 --> pop off the H2O and place a H. 

% assertion of the peak Ni-Zr is okay to suggest asymmetry here. 

% environmental effect catalysts 

% switch.. there's newer... 

% SSHCs now --> more variations in MOFs than in a slab. 

% Bill Scnieder 

% Use story about Cu vs. Ni responding different to environmental conditions

% Motivate/convince that JACS this is important.
