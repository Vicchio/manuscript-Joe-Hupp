% Paragraph 1: Knowledge gap related to the problem about knowing the precise structure of the active site (both when synthesized and then when activated)
\subsection{Paragraph 0}
 Catalysts are vital to the present and future of society, with currently 90\% of the world's consumer goods requiring a catalyst during manufacturing.\cite{Hagen2015} Most industrially relevant catalysts are heterogeneous because of their robustness to reaction conditions and ease of recovery. However, standard bulk heterogeneous catalysts suffer from poorly defined active sites that inhibit molecular understandings of the precise catalyst structure and catalytic mechanisms; this lack of knowledge has limited rational catalyst design for bulk metal catalysts. Over the last two decades, a new area of heterogeneous catalysis has emerged involving metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). MOFs, a porous material formed from inorganic nodes interconnected by organic linkers, function as both a heterogeneous catalysts and catalyst supports.\hl{REFERENCE} MOFs exhibit a diverse platform of tunable structures with well-defined active sites and chemical functionality thus making them an attractive material for single-atom catalysis. 
 % note to self.. I think the end of this paragraph is OKAY.. it's the beginning that needs work.

% There's the large review paper that is good for the introduction section. --> WHICH IS WHAT, STEPHEN? Be sure to write down the review paper...  

\subsection{Paragraph 1}
Within the scientific community, the \ce{Zr} based MOF NU-1000 is commonly used as a catalyst support for 3d metal complexes. Structurally, the NU-1000 MOF contains \ce{Zr} nodes interconnected by carbon based pyrene linkers to generate both large hexagonal channels (30 A), triangular channels (10 A), and small pores (8 A).(\hl{REFERENCE}) The staggered arrangement of protons forming \ce{OH}- and \ce{OH2}-ligand pairs on the node generate anchoring sites for 3d transition metals.\cite{Planas2014} Deposition of 3d transition metal atoms on the MOF framework occurs in the vapor phase via atomic layer deposition (ALD) in MOFs (AIM) \hl{REFERENCE} and in condensed phase via solvothermal deposition in MOFs (SIM) \hl{REFERENCE}. The \ce{OH_{x}}-ligands within the small pore (\~8 A) of NU-1000 preferentially bind the metal species within the framework,\cite{Gallington2016,Rimoldi2017} and the synthesis conditions regulate the active species loading to generate complex active site structures.\cite{Kim2015} Elucidating the exact structure of the active site is challenging; characterization of the metal active sites is suppressed by the bulk framework structure, leading to questions about the structure and composition of the synthesized active site.

% Paragraph 2: More specific issue and problems 
% the different types of potential models for these systems.. there are different modeling choices that can be made for these systems.. talk about the different Ni(II) models comprised of a single Ni(II) atoms.. 
\subsection{Paragraph 2}
Combined experimental characterization and computational modeling has provided insights the active site structure for 3d transition metals supported on the standard NU-1000 MOF framework. The primary focus remains understanding the exact composition of the active site structure that are dependent on the number of metal species. A mononuclear (single-site) model was originally thought to be the active site structure for metals supported on NU-1000.\cite{Li2016sintering,AbdelMageed2019,Gallington2016} Mechanistic investigations into ethylene hydrogenation\cite{Shabbir2020} and propyne partial hydrogenation and isomerization\cite{Hackler2020} use a mononuclear model to high-throughout screen different metal species. \citeauthor{Shabbir2020} demonstrates the different proton tolopogies the mononuclear active site can adopt,\cite{Shabbir2020} while \citeauthor{Hackler2020} investigates two different \ce{H2} splitting pathways on a mononuclear active site.\cite{Hackler2020} A potential limitation of these findings, however, is the usage of a mononuclear model. The structure of the active site has been refined revealing that the metal species supported in the c-pore are more likely to be multinuclear (i.e., consisting of multiple metal species). Using difference envelope density (DED),\cite{Li2017} and differential pair distribution function (dPDF) analysis,\cite{PlateroPrats2017} the formation of multinuclear clusters within the c-pore has been established as the active site for NU-1000. A recent study by \citeauthor{Kim2020}  illustrates the multinuclearity of the active site by determining metal loading per node for different metal precursors.\cite{Kim2020} With metal complex deposition occurring only within the c-pore using the ALD process, metal loading greater than 2 metal atoms per node suggest an active site containing multiple metal atoms. Providing further insight to the multinuclear active site structure for \ce{Ni} complexes, \citeauthor{PlateroPrats2017} suggest the formation of tetranuclear heterobimetallic nanowires spanning the length of the c-pore with the cluster attached to two nodes.\citeauthor{PlateroPrats2017} For \ce{Cu} complexes, \citeauthor{Ikuno2017} proposes a similar trinuclear structure that also spans the c-pore of NU-1000. Experimentally, the nature of the active site for metal complexes on NU-1000 is multinuclear rather than mononuclear; however, the precise structure of the multinuclear active site remains unknown. 

\subsection{Paragraph 3}
Further complicating our understanding of the active site structure is the structural changes induced  by the reaction environment during both the activation step and the reaction steps. The activation environment, and therefore the structural changes, determine the reaction mechanism, such as dehydrogenation, hydrogenation, dimerization, oligomerization. The reaction environment includes both the temperature and gas phase species. \citeauthor{Kim2015} experimentally determined that the metal loading of \ce{In} deceased from  6 \ce{In} per node to 2 \ce{In} per node as the temperature increased from \SI{80}{Celsius} to \SI{200}{Celsius}.\cite{Kim2015} For ethylene hydrogenation, \citeauthor{Li2016sintering} proposes a mechanism on a mononuclear (single-site) \ce{Ni(II)} complex that is activated with \ce{H2} gas to form a \ce{Ni} hydride by removing a coordinated \ce{OH}-ligand.\cite{Li2016sintering} In a similar \ce{H2} environment, \citeauthor{Halder2020} experimentally demonstrated that above \SI{200}{Celsius} the trinuclear \ce{Cu(II)}-clusters supported on NU-1000 are reduced to zero-valent \ce{Cu(0)} species and stripped away from the node with the NU-1000 framework reverting back to the original unit cell dimensions.\cite{Halder2020} Conversely, when exposed to similar reducing conditions the tetranuclear \ce{Ni(II)} cluster shows only subtle structural variations up to 200 oC\cite{PlateroPrats2017} suggesting the cluster is stable under these conditions and that the initial activation only produces subtle changes into the structure of the cluster. Proposed dimerization mechanisms on the tetranuclear \ce{Ni(II)} cluster activate with \ce{Et2AlCl} to remove \ce{OH}-ligands within the cluster as coordinated \ce{H2O} species and generate the active \ce{C2H5}$^*$ species coordinated to the \ce{Ni} atoms.\cite{Ye2017} Using a mononuclar site \ce{Co} cluster, \citeauthor{Li2017} proposes an activation step involving \ce{O2} gas that removes a coordinated \ce{H2O} and alters the coordination environment of the \ce{Co} atom. The metal complexes supported on MOFs, here specifically NU-1000, demonstrate structural variations depending on reaction conditions. To further our understanding of these metal complex active site structures and design better catalysts, there is a need to understand the transformation of the active site structure depending on the reaction environment. 

\subsection{Paragraph 4}
Herein our work addresses questions related to the structural changes of the metal complex active site as a function of both temperature and gas phase conditions. By combining Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations with gas phase empirical models, we investigate cluster stability under different gas phase conditions (\ce{H2}) and temperature. Modeling focuses on the \ce{Ni4(OH)6} cluster proposed by \citeauthor{PlateroPrats2017} and the \ce{Cu3(OH)4} cluster proposed by \cite{Ikuno2017}. Our results provide structural information about the types of changes exhibited by the cluster to establish more appropriate molecular models. 



\newpage
\section{Methodology}
We use a multinuclear \ce{Ni(II)} as a model to investigate how the reaction conditions, such as temperature ($T$) and pressure ($P$), influence the structure and composition of a supported metal complex. The model \ce{Ni(II)} complex (shown in Figure \ref{fig:ref_Ni4_structure}) is located within the small pore of NU-1000. The process of \ce{H2} adsorption and dissociation generates new structures that are compositional different relative to the reference structure. The metal complex features \ce{OH^{*}} and \ce{M^{*}} sites and, when activated with molecular \ce{H2}, accept \ce{H} species. The \ce{OH^{*}} sites can accept a \ce{H} atom to form adsorbed \ce{H2O}, that can desorb into the gas phase depending on conditions. The \ce{M^{*}} sites can accept an \ce{H} atom to form a metal hydride (\ce{M-H}). All the aforementioned transformations are dependent on the partial pressure of \ce{H2} ($P_{H_2}$), the partial pressure of \ce{H2O} ($P_{H_{2}O}$), and the reaction temperature ($T$). We model the changes in cluster structure and composition as a function of reaction conditions by computing the free energy of compositionally different structures (with respect to the number of \ce{H^{*}}, \ce{OH^{*}} and \ce{M^{*}} species) relative to a reference structure. 

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.20\textwidth]{zi-images/00-General-Graphics/Reference-structure.png}
    \caption{Structure of the multinuclear Ni(II) cluster supported on NU-1000. The cluster spans the small pore in NU-1000, and therefore attaches to two nodes. The structure is the reference for all \textit{ab initio} thermodynamic analysis calculations.}
    \label{fig:ref_Ni4_structure}
\end{figure}

We use \textit{ab initio} thermodynamic analysis to compute the stability of the different structural and compositional variations by transforming the free energy from a fixed number of atoms ($N_i$) to a fixed chemical potential ($\mu_i$). The free energy is transformed with respect to $\mu_{H^{*}}$, $\mu_{OH^{*}}$, and $\mu_{M^{*}}$ to account for structural and compositional variations in the number of \ce{H^{*}}, \ce{OH^{*}} and \ce{M^{*}} on the cluster (Figure \ref{fig:FPT-process}). Equation \ref{eq:free-energy-trans} shows the free energy difference ($\Delta F^{(3)}(T,\mu_{H^{*}},\mu_{OH^{*}},\mu_{M^{*}})$) between structure $j$ and the reference structure ($ref$).  (see Supporting Information for the full derivation).
\begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
        \Delta F^{(3)}(T,\mu_{H^{*}},\mu_{OH^{*}},\mu_{M^{*}})  = 
        & F_{j}(T,N_{j,H^{*}},N_{j,OH^{*}},N_{j,M^{*}}) - 
          F_{ref}(T,N_{ref,H^{*}},N_{ref,OH^{*}},N_{ref,M^{*}}) \\
        & - (\mu_{H^{*}})(\Delta N_{H^{*}}) - (\mu_{OH^{*}})(\Delta N_{OH^{*}}) - (\mu_{M^{*}})(\Delta N_{M^{*}}) \\ 
    \end{split}
    \label{eq:free-energy-trans}
\end{equation}
The $F_{j}(T,N_{j,H^{*}},N_{j,OH^{*}},N_{j,M^{*}})$ term is the free energy of structure $j$ with configuration of $N_{j,H^{*}}$, $N_{j,OH^{*}}$, and $N_{j,M^{*}}$. The $\Delta N_{H^{*}}$, $\Delta N_{OH^{*}}$, and $\Delta N_{M^{*}}$ terms are the difference between $N_{j}$ and $N_{ref}$ for that particular species. 

The chemical potential terms,  $\mu_{H^{*}}$ and $\mu_{OH^{*}}$, depend on the temperature and gas phase reaction conditions. We assume that $\ce{H^{*}}$ and $\ce{OH^{*}}$ are in equilibrium with an ideal-gas like reservoir with of \ce{H2} and \ce{H2O}, respectively (as shown in Figure \ref{fig:FPT-process}). The chemical potential of the reservoir is dependent on the reaction conditions ($T$ and $P$). The assumed equilibrium for $\ce{H^{*}}$ is with $\frac{1}{2}$ \ce{H2} (g) and for $\ce{OH^{*}}$ is with \ce{H2O} (g)/$\frac{1}{2}$\ce{H2} (g) (Equation \ref{eq:reaction_equilibrium}). The combined expression for $\ce{OH^{*}}$ captures the influence of both \ce{H2O} and \ce{H2} gas phase conditions on the stability of the cluster (further details in the Supporting Information).
\begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
        \frac{1}{2} H_{2} (g) & \ce{<=>} H^{*} \\           
        \frac{1}{2} H_{2} (g) + OH^{*} & \ce{<=>} H_{2}O (g)  
    \end{split}
    \label{eq:reaction_equilibrium}
\end{equation}
Using Equation \ref{eq:reaction_equilibrium}, the relationship between the $\ce{H^{*}}$ and $\ce{OH^{*}}$ species and the gas phase \ce{H2} and \ce{H2O} conditions are shown in Equation \ref{eq:chemicalpotentialeq}. The $\mu_{i}^{g}(T,P)$ terms contain the temperature and pressure influences of the reaction conditions. 
\begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
        \mu_{H^{*}} &= \frac{1}{2} \mu_{H_{2}}^{g}(T,P) \\ 
        \mu_{OH^{*}} &= \mu_{H_{2}O}^{g}(T,P) - \frac{1}{2} \mu_{H_{2}}^{g}(T,P) \\
    \end{split}
    \label{eq:chemicalpotentialeq}
\end{equation}
 The gas phase chemical potential terms ($\mu_{i}^{g}(T,P)$) are computed by correcting the electronic energy (referenced at $T$=0 K) of an isolated molecule with a term ($\Delta \mu_{H_{2}}(T,P)$) that includes all the temperature- and pressure- dependent free-energy contributions. 
\begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
        \mu_{H_{2}}^{g}(T,P) &= E_{H_2} + \Delta \mu_{H_{2}}(T,P)  \\  
        \mu_{H_{2}O}^{g}(T,P) &= E_{H_{2}O} + \Delta \mu_{H_{2}O}(T,P) 
    \end{split}
    \label{eq:chemicalpotentialrel}
\end{equation}
Where
\begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
        \Delta \mu_{H_{2}}(T,P) &= \Big[ \Delta G_{H_{2}}(T,P^{o}) + RT \ln{\Big( \frac{P_{H_{2}}}{P^{o}} \Big)} \Big] \\
        \Delta \mu_{H_{2}O}(T,P^{o}) &=  \Big[ \Delta G_{H_{2}O}(T,P^{o}) + RT \ln{\Big( \frac{P_{H_{2}O}}{P^{o}} \Big)} \Big]
    \end{split}
\end{equation}
The gas-phase Gibbs free energies ($\Delta G_{i}(T,P^{o})$) at standard pressure ($P^{o}$) were computed using the NASA Polynomials\cite{Mcbride1993} in the pMuTT\cite{LYM2019106864} Python package. The pressure effects ($P_{H_{2}}$ and $P_{H_{2}O}$) are captured assuming ideal gas. The final expression for $\mu_{H_{2}}^{g}(T,P)$ and $\mu_{H_{2}O}^{g}(T,P)$ is given by Equation \ref{eq:chemicalpotentialrel}. 
\begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
        \mu_{H_{2}}^{g}(T,P) &=  E_{H_{2}} + \Big[ \Delta G_{H_{2}}(T,P^{o}) + RT \ln{\Big( \frac{P_{H_{2}}}{P^{o}} \Big)} \Big] \\  
        \mu_{H_{2}O}^{g}(T,P) &=  E_{H_{2}O} + \Big[ \Delta G_{H_{2}O}(T,P^{o}) + RT \ln{\Big( \frac{P_{H_{2}O}}{P^{o}} \Big)} \Big]
    \end{split}
    \label{eq:chemicalpotentialrel}
\end{equation}

Unlike the gas phase chemical potential terms, the metal chemical potential term ($\mu_{M^{*}}$) is independent of the reaction conditions and the metal chemical potential term assumed to be in equilibrium with a bulk metal system. The chemical potential $\mu_{M^{*}}$ is approximated by the electronic energy for a bulk metal system (see Supporting Information). 

Combining Equations \ref{eq:free-energy-trans}, \ref{eq:chemicalpotentialeq}, and \ref{eq:chemicalpotentialrel} produces the final transformed free energy expression (shown in the supporting information). The free energy expression was solved at every combination of $T$, $P_{H_2}$, and $P_{H_{2}O}$ for all structures. We generate a library of unique, modified structures for the \textit{ab initio} thermodynamic analysis by systematically adding \ce{H} atoms to different atoms on metal cluster and then removing any formed \ce{H2O}. Each modified structure was optimized at each addition of \ce{H} atoms and removal of adsorbed \ce{H2O}. There are specific combinations of \ce{H^{*}}, \ce{OH^{*}} and \ce{M^{*}} within the library. At all combinations of $T$, $P_{H_2}$, and $P_{H_{2}O}$, the lowest free energy structure was identified thereby revealing the thermodynamic landscape of the modified metal cluster under reducing conditions.

    \label{fig:FPT-process}
\end{figure}

The energies for the structures are from periodic density functional (DFT) calculations in CP2K.\cite{Hutter2014} The exchange correlation energy was calculated with the PBE functional\cite{Perdew1996} and corrected using damped D3 dispersion corrections formulated by \citeauthor{Grimme2010}.\cite{Grimme2010} The DZVP-MOLOPT basis set describes the valance electrons, Goedecker pseudopotentials\cite{Goedecker1996} describes the core electrons. The plane wave cutoff energy is 360 Ry and  all atoms in the periodic unit cell were allowed to relax during geometry optimizations (see Supporting information for a sample input file for further computational details). The variable spin states of the metal atoms required Unrestricted Kohn-Sham (UKS). For example, \ce{Ni(II)} can adopt both singlet (no unpaired electrons) and triplet (two unpaired electron) configurations. For clusters compromised of multiple metal atoms, all permutations of spin state configurations are simulated and included in the library of candidate structures. Any structures exhibiting spin contamination were removed from the analysis (see support information for more details).

\hl{How the PDFs are calculated from the model structures is something that is going to need to be included by Karena and Woodrow here.}

\section{Results Outline}


We create phase diagrams that show the stability of different configurations and clusters as a function of $T$, $P_{\text{\ce{H2}}}$, and $P_{\text{\ce{H2O}}}$. At each set of conditions, the structure with the lowest free energy is identified and plotted to produce the phase diagram. The regions on the phase diagram correspond to a specific low energy structure, and at the interface between two regions the free energies values are the same. To reduce complexity, the phase diagrams show structural stability at a fixed partial pressure of $P_{\text{\ce{H2O}}} = 10^{-9} \text{bar}$ with the value selected to account for all \ce{H2O} removed at 100 oC. We expect a small value for \ce{H2O} partial pressure the activation conditions do not contain any \ce{H2O}. The only \ce{H2O} present on the cluster is from the initial hydration during synthesis or from the conversion of \ce{OH}-ligands into \ce{H2O} during the activation. The hydrated and anhydrated phase diagram for the \ce{Ni4(OH)6} cluster is located in the Supporting Information.

% fully transforming... 
The cluster is fully transformed with respect to composition of $\ce{H^{*}}$, $\ce{OH^{*}}$, and $\ce{Ni^{*}}$, and the low energy structures are plotted in Figure \ref{fig:phase_diagram_TandP_trans_Ni} a). Figure \ref{fig:structure_diagram_TandP_trans_Ni} a) shows that increasing \ce{H2} partial pressure decreases the $\ce{Ni^{*}}$ and $\ce{OH^{*}}$  composition of the cluster. The \ce{Ni4(OH)6 \cdot 4H2O} structure (orange) is the full hydrated \ce{Ni4(OH)6} cluster, which becomes the partially hydrated \ce{Ni4(OH)6 \cdot H2O} structure (gray) and then the dehydrated \ce{Ni4(OH)6} structure (purple) with increasing temperature. At temperatures above ~130 oC, the thermodynamically dominate structure shifts from \ce{Ni4(OH)6} (purple) to \ce{Ni4(OH)4} (light blue) to \ce{Ni3(OH)2} (red) to \ce{(NiH)2} (lilac) with increasing \ce{H2} partial pressure. The transition from \ce{Ni4(OH)6} to \ce{Ni4(OH)4} occurs via the loss of \ce{\mu_{3}-OH} ligands because of the exposure to \ce{H2} gas during the activation conditions. The transition from \ce{Ni4(OH)4} to \ce{Ni3(OH)2} coincides with the further loss of \ce{\mu_{2}-OH} ligands and a single \ce{Ni} atom. The transition from \ce{Ni3(OH)2} to \ce{(NiH)2} demonstrates the further loss of \ce{\mu_{2}-OH} ligands and a single \ce{Ni} atom to produce a complex that is not attached to two nodes of NU-1000. The activate site now consists of two isolated \ce{Ni-H} metal complexes. We further evaluated the removal of the entire complex. The white dashed line in Figure \ref{fig:structure_diagram_TandP_trans_Ni} identities the boundary between \ce{Ni} remaining attached to the cluster and \ce{Ni} being stripped away. To the left of the white dashed line, the preferred composition of the cluster is the \ce{Ni4(OH)6} structure without any adsorbed \ce{H2O}. To the right of the white dashed line, the preferred composition if the NU-1000 MOF support without any \ce{Ni} supported metal complex.

We evaluate the performance of our model by comparing the dPDFs of the model structures to the experimental activation dPDF of \citeauthor{PlateroPrats2017}. The dPDFs provide structural insights into the cluster by revealing key interatomic distances with peaks indicating the distance between different atoms. Experimentally, the significant dPDF peaks are the \ce{Ni-O} bond length at \hl{XXX}, the \ce{Ni \cdots Ni} distances at \hl{XXX} and \hl{XXX}, and the \ce{Ni \cdots Zr} distances at \hl{XXX} and \hl{XXX}. The experimental, activated dPDFs for \ce{Ni \cdots Ni} and \ce{Ni \cdots Zr} contain multiple peaks (hence the multiple distances), thus suggest the formation of an asymmetric cluster. Figure \ref{fig:dPDFs_TandP_trans_Ni} shows the dPDFs for all the thermodynamically favorable structures found in Figure \hl{XXX}.

We compare the the thermodynamically favorable structures from Figure \ref{fig:phase_diagram_TandP_trans_Ni} to the activated dPDF in Figure \hl{XXXXXX}.
\begin{itemize}
    \item The \ce{Ni} peak around 2.1 A.

Despite Figure \ref{fig:structure_diagram_TandP_trans_Ni} suggesting the complete breakdown of the cluster in a bulk-\ce{Ni} species, there is no experimental evidence. Therefore, we remove all structures with a \ce{Ni} compositional less than four and remove the \ce{Ni} transformation in the free energy expression. Figure \ref{fig:phase_diagram_TandP_fixed_Ni} shows the thermodynamic stability as a function of T and P-H2 at a fixed partial pressure of H2O and \ce{Ni} composition.

\section{Results}
In this work, we show the stability of \ce{Ni(II)} and \ce{Cu(II)} clusters under reducing reaction conditions. The reference cluster is exposed to gaseous molecular \ce{H2} to induce structural changes on the cluster, which results in a modified structure. Phase diagrams show the stability of the cluster as a function of reaction temperature and \ce{H2} partial pressure at a fixed \ce{H2O} partial pressure. The \ce{H2O} partial pressure is {$10^{-13}$} atm, which is within the range of ultra high vacuum conditions \hl{REFERENCE FOR THESE CONDITIONS}. We do not expect a large \ce{H2O} partial pressure because gas phase \ce{H2O} species are formed from the removal of \ce{OH}-ligands in the cluster. Phase diagrams that vary the \ce{H2O} partial pressure can be found in the \hl{Supporting Information}. Figure \hl{XXX} shows the stability of the \ce{Ni(II)} cluster. 



We reduce the complexity of \ref{fig:phase_diagram_TandP_fixed_Ni} by defining two sets of reaction conditions to plot the free energy for all species in the \ce{Ni(II)} cluster library. The first set of conditions is at room temperature ($T = 20 ^{o}C$) and in the absence of \ce{H2} gas ($P_{H2}$ = \hl{XXX}) to show the stability of the cluster. The second set of conditions is activation conditions, with temperatures around $T = 200 ^{o}C$ and pressures around \hl{5\% H2 in 95\% (cite all the articles that activate with H2)}.      

%TODO: need to write the python script to show the differences...

        \item need to select a partial pressure of H2O, which we will select as 10-10 to 10-15 because this is about the pressure for UHV..and I can plot the variation of this assumption in the SI for the paper to show. 
        \item Last statement..which will show in the SI a structure that contains the full cluster stripped away from MOFs... the phase diagram show the transformation of all Ni atoms away from the cluster

\newpage
\subsection{Discussion}
The stability of metal complexes supported on MOFs depend on the reaction environment. 

%The \ce{Ni(II)} metal complex structure is dependent on the environment. In the absence of any \ce{H2}, the cluster contains four \ce{Ni(II)} atoms interconnected by \ce{OH}-ligands as suggested by \hl{REFERENCE Platero-Prats}. The tetranuclear configuration of the \ce{Ni(II)} cluster spans the c-pore of the NU-1000 framework. When exposed to \ce{H2} gas, the \ce{OH}-ligands provide sites for \ce{H} adsorption onto the cluster resulting in the formation of \ce{H2O}.  \hl{HIGHLIGHT THE SINTERING PAPER} investigate \ce{H2} adsorption and dissociation on a single \ce{Ni} atom also supported on NU-1000, finding that barriers for \ce{H2} adsorption and dissociation and removal of \ce{H2O} are 141 $kJ/mol$. However within our work, we do not look at the kinetics of \ce{H2} adsorption and dissociation and the subsequent removal of \ce{H2O}. Our discussion focuses on the equilibrium thermodynamic structure resulting from exposure to \ce{H2} gas at different partial pressure and temperatures. 


\begin{itemize}
    \item Discussion Topic 1:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Analysis suggests that ultimately the cluster is in a meta-stable state that is driven towards the breakdown of the cluster. When transforming with the number of \ce{Ni} atoms we account for leeched \ce{Ni} atoms using a bulk \ce{Ni} model.
        \item No experimental observations about \ce{Ni(II)} leeching to form \ce{Ni(0)}-NPs in NU-1000 within the literature. However, there are discussions about the reduction of \ce{Cu(II)} to \ce{Cu(0)} under \ce{H2} reducing conditions at these temperatures. A consideration is the temperature of activation. The formation of \ce{Ni(0)}-NPs might occur at activation temperatures higher than the current standard activation conditions within the literature for MOF systems. Revisit the discussion/reference about \ce{Ni} vs. \ce{Cu} stability. 
        \item Also there could be kinetic limitations explaining why \ce{Ni} isn't leeched from the cluster. 
    \end{itemize}
    \item Discussion Topic 2:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The suggested model structure is the light blue structure, which shows that the mu3-OH ligands are removed. Note that this structure does NOT show any Ni-H formation on the cluster.
        \item Thermodynamically, active site formation does not demonstrate the formation of a \ce{Ni-H}, which is often to be the active species here. Possible explanation is that the dominate species here is not the \ce{Ni-H}. 
        \item The other explanation is that the \ce{Ni-H} could be the catalytically active site species; however, it might not be the lowest energy structure thermodynamically (meaning that it will not appear in on the phase diagram). There is a possibility that a distribution of active site structures exists, and that the active site structure that is catalytically active is not the dominate structure. 
        \item Additionally, something we did not consider was the \ce{H2} dissociation barriers onto \ce{Ni}. \citeauthor{Li2016sintering} demonstrate a barrier height for the transformation an \ce{OH}-site with \ce{H2} into a \ce{H}-site and \ce{H2O} of around 141 kJ/mol. Having such a high barrier is significant, and does suggest that kinetic limitations could also be present in our model. Our phase diagram is not able to capture, and include these kinetic limitations in the analysis. 
        \item Although we see the breakdown the cluster, kinetic barriers related to \ce{H2} adsorption and dissociation might inhibit the further breakdown of the cluster.
        \item Nonetheless, our model still provides clues into the potential active site structure of the \ce{Ni4(OH)6} cluster. 
    \end{itemize}
    \item Discussion Topic 3:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item  Comparing the work from \citeauthor{PlateroPrats2017}, the majority of the structures contains under-coordinated \ce{Ni-atoms}. Experimentally, a coordination number of ~5 was observed.
        \item There are features shown on the phase diagram that are not present on the most recent, especially at high \ce{H2} partial pressures. At high \ce{H2} partial pressure, the structures start showing the presence of \ce{Ni-Ni} bonds. The peaks associated with \ce{Ni-Ni} bond formation are not seen experimentally, which suggests the cluster remains largely intact after activation. Throughout our analysis, as the cluster is reduced the formation is \ce{Ni-Ni} bonds is observed.     
        \item The dPDFs are from XRD data that is the average of ALL potential structures within the MOF framework.. the model dPDFs are snapshots of potential structures within the framework here. There is probably a distribution of active site structures that is dominated by the lowest energy structures. 
    \end{itemize}
    \item Discussion Topic 4:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Could this help explain some of the discrepancies in reaction trends observed by \citeauthor{Shabbir2020} for \ce{Ni(II)} for \ce{C2H4} hydrogenation? The catalytically active site structure is the \ce{Ni-H} structure. However, thermodynamically, the formation of the \ce{Ni-H} is not dominate. Therefore, only a small number of sites are actually participating in the reaction. \hl{At least for Ni in Hafeera's work this could explain the differences in rates.}
        \item The influence of species such as formate being present on the node. Literature suggests that the reason a cluster forms, and why it forms within the c-pore, is because of the formate ligands capping the \ce{OH/H2O}-ligand pairs of the node. Comparing model and experimental clusters will depend on the experimental synthesis protocols. Only recently was the role of formate understood on the structure of the MOF node.  
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}



%\begin{itemize}
%    \item The structural characteristics of the supported metal complexes are dependent on the reaction conditions.
%    \begin{itemize}
%        \item In the presence of a reducing agent (\ce{H2}), the hydroxo-ligands of the supported metal complexes are %removed (as \ce{H2O}). As previously suggested, we show computationally that \ce{H2} is important in breaking the %bonds between the metal clusters and the NU-1000 nodes. We provide the thermodynamic landscape for these %transformations.
%        \item Our findings show similar structural features and suggest that in an \ce{H2} reducing environment these %supported metal complexes containing \ce{OH}-ligands are not stable.  
%        \item At present, our modeling efforts demonstrate the formation of the more mobile \ce{M(0)} species. The breakdown %of the supported metal complex (removal of \ce{OH}-ligands within the cluster) reduces the metal atoms, thereby %generating the mobile \ce{M(0)} species.
%    \end{itemize}
%    \item A key question that still remains is whether these reduced supported metal complexes still exist as a combination %of NPs and multinuclear metal active sites or mononuclear active sites (single-sites) above \SI{200}{Celsius}.
%    \begin{itemize}
%        \item \citeauthor{Halder2020} determined that in an \ce{H2} environment the \ce{Cu3(OH)4} supported metal complexes %showed large \ce{Cu} NP formation. These particles were ~6.0 nm in diameter, which is larger than the ~3.0 nm %diameter hexagonal pore in NU-1000. Therefore, for \ce{Cu}-NU-1000 we know that these NPs grow, and we show using %our modeling that for \ce{Ni} we expect \ce{Ni} NPs to grow as well. 
%        \item Our present results support the experimental findings of \citeauthor{Halder2020} that reduced metal atoms are %generated. However, we extend the findings further and hypothesize that some of the single-site metal atoms remain %intact. Not all of the metal atoms are reduced to \ce{M(0)}; the metal atoms attached to the \ce{OH}-ligands of the %node remain. 
%        \item There are a few more additional calculations to be computed to test our theory (and these calculations are %currently being performed). The calculations contain two single-site models (with and without the \ce{M-H} species). %The metal atoms removed from the system will be accounted for as nanoclusters.
%    \end{itemize}
%\end{itemize}
%We have the following list of questions:
%\begin{itemize}
%    \item Experimentally, there is a different in the protocols to generate the single-site and the clusters in NU-1000? %Experimentally, you can differentiate between the two different catalysts in NU-1000? 
%    \item When looking at the Cu-NU-1000 discussion, did you ever remove the Cu-NPs and determine whether the framework that %was left behind was catalytically active? We wonder whether or not all the metal atoms are becoming the mobile \ce{M(0)} %species. 
%    \item The hexagonal pore returned to its original ~34 A value. How does the value of the pore compare when there are %single-site metal atoms attached to the node? 
%\end{itemize}

%The use of \textsf{natbib} allows the use of the various citation
%commands of that package: \citeauthor{Abernethy2003} have shown
%something, in \citeyear{Cotton1999}, or as given by

%\cite{Johnson1972,*Arduengo1992,*Eisenstein2005,*Arduengo%1994}.
%Citations other than the first of the list should be %indicated
