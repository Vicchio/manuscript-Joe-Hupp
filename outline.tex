Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are an attractive support for single-atom catalysis ... \hl{Check the bruce gates article that talks about the different nanocatalyst supports.. }
%TODO Need a broad statement about Zr based MOFs and their applications 

Specifically, the 


NU-1000 is comprised of \ce{Zr6(\mu_3-OH)4(\mu_3-O)4(OH)4(OH2)4} nodes connected by tetratopic 1,3,6,8-tetrakis(p-benzoic acid)pyrene linkers, and contains channels parallel to the c-direction forming both large hexagonal channels (\~30 A) and triangular channels (\~10 A), with adjacent pores further connected by small pores (\~8 A).(\hl{REFERENCE}) NU-1000 is an attractive platform to support a plethora of metal complexes because the staggered arrangement of protons forming \ce{OH}- and \ce{OH2}-ligand pairs on the node generate anchoring sites for 3d transition metals.\cite{Planas2014} Deposition of 3d transition metal atoms on MOF framework occurs in the vapor phase via atomic layer deposition (ALD) in MOFs (AIM) \hl{REFERENCE} and in condensed phase via solvothermal deposition in MOFs (SIM), \hl{REFERENCE}. The \ce{OH_{x}}-ligands within the small pore (\~8 A) of NU-1000 preferentially bind the metal species within the framework,\cite{Gallington2016,Rimoldi2017} and the synthesis conditions regulate the active species loading to generate complex active site structures.\cite{Kim2015} Elucidating the exact structure of the active site is challenging; characterization of the metal active sites is suppressed by the bulk framework structure, leading to questions about the structure and composition of the synthesized active site. To understand the catalytic mechanisms for metal complexes attached to MOFs, additional information about the active site under a variety of conditions is required. 

% Paragraph 2: More specific issue and problems

\subsection{Paragraph 2}
Combined experimental characterization and computational modeling has provided insights the active site structure for 3d transition metals supported on the standard NU-1000 MOF framework. The primary focus remains understanding the exact composition of the active site structure that are dependent on the number of metal species. A mononuclear (single-site) model was originally thought to be the active site structure for metals supported on NU-1000.\cite{Li2016sintering,AbdelMageed2019,Gallington2016} Mechanistic investigations into ethylene hydrogenation\cite{Shabbir2020} and propyne partial hydrogenation and isomerization\cite{Hackler2020} use a mononuclear model to high-throughout screen different metal species. \citeauthor{Shabbir2020} demonstrates the different proton tolopogies the mononuclear active site can adopt,\cite{Shabbir2020} while \citeauthor{Hackler2020} investigates two different \ce{H2} splitting pathways on a mononuclear active site.\citeauthor{Hackler2020} A potential limitation of these findings, however, is the usage of a mononuclear model. The structure of the active site has been refined revealing that the metal species supported in the c-pore are more likely to be multinuclear (i.e., consisting of multiple metal species). Using difference envelope density (DED),\cite{Li2017} and differential pair distribution function (dPDF) analysis,\cite{PlateroPrats2017} the formation of multinuclear clusters within the c-pore has been established as the active site for NU-1000. A recent study by \citeauthor{Kim2020}  illustrates the multinuclearity of the active site by determining metal loading per node for different metal precursors.\cite{Kim2020} With metal complex deposition occurring only within the c-pore, metal loading greater than 2 metal atoms per node suggest an active site containing multiple metal atoms. Providing further insight to the multinuclear active site structure for \ce{Ni} complexes, \citeauthor{PlateroPrats2017} suggest the formation of tetranuclear heterobimetallic nanowires spanning the length of the c-pore with the cluster attached to two nodes.\citeauthor{PlateroPrats2017} For \ce{Cu} complexes, \citeauthor{Ikuno2017} proposes a similar trinuclear structure that also spans the c-pore of NU-1000. Experimentally, the nature of the active site for metal complexes on NU-1000 is multinuclear rather than mononuclear; however, the precise structure of the multinuclear active site remains unknown. 

%Interstingly.. some of the clusters also do NOT exhibit self limiting behavior, whereas some metal spcecies do.

\subsection{Paragraph 3}
Further complicating our understanding of the active site structure is the structural changes induced  by the reaction environment during both the activation step and the reaction steps. The activation environment, and therefore the structural changes, determine the reaction mechanism, such as dehydrogenation, hydrogenation, dimerization, oligomerization. The reaction environment includes both the temperature and gas phase species. \citeauthor{Kim2015} experimentally determined that the metal loading of \ce{In} deceased from \~6 \ce{In} per node to \~2 \ce{In} per node as the temperature increased from \SI{80}{Celsius} to \SI{200}{Celsius}.\cite{Kim2015} For ethylene hydrogenation, \citeauthor{Li2016sintering} proposes a mechanism on a mononuclear (single-site) \ce{Ni(II)} complex that is activated with \ce{H2} gas to form a \ce{Ni} hydride by removing a coordinated \ce{OH}-ligand.\cite{Li2016sintering} In a similar \ce{H2} environment, \citeauthor{Halder2020} experimentally demonstrated that above \SI{200}{Celsius} the trinuclear \ce{Cu(II)}-clusters supported on NU-1000 are reduced to zero-valent \ce{Cu(0)} species and stripped away from the node with the NU-1000 framework reverting back to the original unit cell dimensions.\cite{Halder2020} Conversely, when exposed to similar reducing conditions the tetranuclear \ce{Ni(II)} cluster shows only subtle structural variations up to 200 oC\cite{PlateroPrats2017} suggesting the cluster is stable under these conditions and that the initial activation only produces subtle changes into the structure of the cluster. Proposed dimerization mechanisms on the tetranuclear \ce{Ni(II)} cluster activate with \ce{Et2AlCl} to remove \ce{OH}-ligands within the cluster as coordinated \ce{H2O} species and generate the active \ce{C2H5}$^*$ species coordinated to the \ce{Ni} atoms.\cite{Ye2017} Using a mononuclar site \ce{Co} cluster, \citeauthor{Li2017} proposes an activation step involving \ce{O2} gas that removes a coordinated \ce{H2O} and alters the coordination environment of the \ce{Co} atom. The metal complexes supported on MOFs, here specifically NU-1000, demonstrate structural variations depending on reaction conditions. To further our understanding of these metal complex active site structures and design better catalysts, there is a need to understand the transformation of the active site structure depending on the reaction environment.

%% Methodology
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\newpage
\section{Methodology}
We demonstrate the influence of reaction conditions, such as temperature ($T$) and pressure ($P$), on supported metal complex stability using thermodynamic analysis to compute the free energy of different activated structures. Specifically, \textit{ab initio} thermodynamic analysis computes the structurally stability of compositionally different structures by transforming the free energy from a fixed number of atoms to a fixed chemical potential. The reference supported metal complex on NU-1000, formed from the ALD process, is comprised of adsorbed \ce{OH^{*}} and \ce{M^{*}} species and is activated with molecular \ce{H2} to form \ce{H^{*}} species. The \ce{H^{*}} species are attached to either the \ce{OH^{*}} species forming waters (\ce{H2O^{*}}) or the \ce{M^{*}} species forming metal hydrides (\ce{M-H}). The newly formed modified structure exhibits different composition of \ce{H^{*}}, \ce{OH^{*}} and \ce{M^{*}} species compared to the reference structure. We generate a library of unique, candidate modified structures for the \textit{ab initio} thermodynamic analysis by systematically adding \ce{H} atoms to different atoms on metal cluster and removing any formed \ce{H2O} (\hl{see Supporting Information for further details}).

By transforming the free energy from a fixed number of atoms to a fixed chemical potential ($\mu_{H^{*}}$, $\mu_{OH^{*}}$, and $\mu_{Ni^{*}}$), we determine the thermodynamically favorable modified structures despite having different compositions. Equation \ref{eq:free-energy-trans} shows the generalized free energy expression \hl{(see Supporting Information for more information on derivation).}
\begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
        \Delta G^{(3)}(T,\mu_{H^{*}},\mu_{OH^{*}},\mu_{M^{*}})  = & \Delta G(T,N_{H^{*}},N_{OH^{*}},N_{Ni^{*}}) - (\mu_{H^{*}})(\Delta N_{H^{*}}) \\
        & - (\mu_{OH^{*}})(\Delta N_{OH^{*}}) 
          - (\mu_{M^{*}})(\Delta N_{M^{*}}) \\ 
    \end{split}
    \label{eq:free-energy-trans}
\end{equation}
The $\Delta G(T,N_{H^{*}},N_{OH^{*}},N_{Ni^{*}})$ term is the difference in the modified structure and reference structure (defined here as the as-synthesized, starting MOF structure). The chemical potential terms,  $\mu_{H^{*}}$ and $\mu_{OH^{*}}$, depend on the temperature and gas phase reaction conditions because we assume that the adsorbate species are in equilibrium with an ideal-gas like reservoir with \ce{H2} and \ce{H2O} species. The chemical potential of the reservoir is dependent on the reaction conditions. 

%TODO need to generate the figure showing the transformation of the different metal species 
\begin{figure}
    \centering
    %\includegraphics{}
    \caption{Diagram showing the assumed equilibria necessary to transform with \ce{H^{*}}, \ce{OH^{*}}, and \ce{M^{*}} in the \textit{ab initio} thermodynamic analysis approach. The assumed equilibria for these adsorbed species capture the the reaction conditions on the stability of the metal cluster when using Equation \ref{eq:free-energy-trans}.}
    \label{fig:FPT-process}
\end{figure}

At equilibrium, the chemical potential of the adsorbate species is equal to the chemical potential of the gas phase species. The assumed equilibrium for $\ce{H^{*}}$ is with $\frac{1}{2}\ce{H_{2}^{g}}$ and for $\ce{OH^{*}}$ is with $\ce{H_{2}O^{g}}$/$\frac{1}{2}\ce{H_{2}^{g}}$. The combined expression for $\ce{OH^{*}}$ captures the influence of both \ce{H2O} and \ce{H2} gas phase conditions on the stability of the cluster. For further details \hl{see Support Information}. The metal chemical potential term ($\mu_{M^{*}}$) is independent of the reaction conditions and the metal chemical potential term is approximated by free energy for a bulk metal system. Equation \ref{eq:chemicalpotentialeq} shows the chemical potential expressions for the $\ce{H^{*}}$ and $\ce{OH^{*}}$ adsorbed species with respect to gas phase \ce{H2} and \ce{H2O} conditions. 
\begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
        \mu_{H^{*}} &= \frac{1}{2} \mu_{H_{2}}^{g}(T,P) \\ 
        \mu_{OH^{*}} &= \mu_{H_{2}O}^{g}(T,P) - \frac{1}{2} \mu_{H_{2}}^{g}(T,P) \\
    \end{split}
    \label{eq:chemicalpotentialeq}
\end{equation}
The $\mu_{i}^{g}(T,P)$ terms contain the temperature and pressure influences of the reaction conditions.\textit{ab initio} thermodynamic analysis determines the thermodynamically stable structures by computing the free energy (Equation \ref{eq:free-energy-trans}) as a function of gas phase chemical potential species for all structures in the library. At every combination of $\mu_{H_{2}}^{g}(T,P)$ and $\mu_{H_{2}O}^{g}(T,P)$, the structure with the lowest free energy is identified to generate phase diagrams revealing the thermodynamic landscape of the modified metal cluster under reducing conditions. 

The gas phase chemical potential terms ($\mu_{i}^{g}(T,P)$) are computed by by correcting the electronic energy (referenced at $T$=0 K) of an isolated molecule with the gas-phase Gibbs free energy values at a specific temperature and pressure (Equation \ref{eq:chemicalpotentialrel}).
\begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
        \mu_{H_{2}}^{g}(T,P) &= E_{H_2} + \Delta \mu_{H_{2}}(T,P)  = E_{H_{2}} + \Big[ \Delta G_{H_{2}}(T,P^{o}) + RT \ln{\Big( \frac{P_{H_{2}}}{P^{o}} \Big)} \Big] \\  
        \mu_{H_{2}O}^{g}(T,P) &= E_{H_{2}O} + \Delta \mu_{H_{2}O}(T,P^{o}) =  E_{H_{2}O} + \Big[ \Delta G_{H_{2}O}(T,P^{o}) + RT \ln{\Big( \frac{P_{H_{2}O}}{P^{o}} \Big)} \Big]
    \end{split}
    \label{eq:chemicalpotentialrel}
\end{equation}
 The gas-phase Gibbs free energies ($\Delta G_{i}(T,P^{o})$) were computed using the NASA Polynomials\cite{Mcbride1993} in the pMuTT\cite{LYM2019106864} Python package at standard pressure ($P^{o}$) to capture the influence of temperature. The pressure effects are captured assuming ideal gas for the gas phase species. 
 
All electronic energies were computed from periodic density functional calculations in CP2K.\cite{Hutter2014} The exchange correlation energy was calculated with the PBE functional\cite{Perdew1996} and corrected using damped D3 dispersion corrections formulated by \citeauthor{Grimme2010}.\cite{Grimme2010} The DZVP-MOLOPT basis set (\hl{reference}) describes the valance electrons, Goedecker pseudopotentials\cite{Goedecker1996} describes the core electron. The plane wave cutoff energy is 360 Ry and  all atoms in the periodic unit cell were allowed to relax during geometry optimizations.

Unrestricted Kohn-Sham (UKS) is implemented because of the variable spin states of metal atoms. For example, \ce{Ni(II)} can adopt both singlet (no unpaired electrons) and triplet (two unpaired electron) configurations. For clusters compromised of multiple metal atoms, all permutations of spin state configurations are simulated and included in the library of candidate structure. However, any structures exhibiting spin contamination were removed from the analysis \hl{see support information for more details}.

\section{Results}
In this work, we show the stability of \ce{Ni(II)} and \ce{Cu(II)} clusters under reducing reaction conditions. The reference cluster is exposed to gaseous molecular \ce{H2} to induce structural changes on the cluster, which results in a modified structure. Phase diagrams show the stability of the cluster as a function of reaction temperature and \ce{H2} partial pressure at a fixed \ce{H2O} partial pressure. The \ce{H2O} partial pressure is $10^{-13}$ atm, which is within the range of ultra high vacuum conditions \hl{REFERENCE FOR THESE CONDITIONS}. We do not expect a large \ce{H2O} partial pressure because gas phase \ce{H2O} species are formed from the removal of \ce{OH}-ligands in the cluster. Phase diagrams that vary the \ce{H2O} partial pressure can be found in the \hl{Supporting Information}. Figure \hl{XXX} shows the stability of the \ce{Ni(II)} cluster. 

\begin{figure}
    \centering
%    \includegraphics{}
    \caption{The stability of the \ce{Ni(II)} cluster at a function of temperature and \ce{H2} partial pressure at a \ce{H2O} partial pressure = $10^{-13}$ atm. Regions indicate the the modified structure that minimizes the free energy Equation (\ref{eq:free-energy-trans}) at a given combination of $T/P_{H_{2}}$ and fixed \ce{H2O} partial pressure. The name convention utilized to label each region is used throughout. The \ce{H2} partial pressure is reported as $log(P_{H_{2}}/P_{H_{2}}^{o})$, where the standard state is 1 atm.}
    \label{fig:phase_diagram_TandP}
\end{figure}

We reduce the complexity of \ref{fig:phase_diagram_TandP} by defining two sets of reaction conditions to plot the free energy for all species in the \ce{Ni(II)} cluster library. The first set of conditions is at room temperature ($T = 20 ^{o}C$) and in the absence of \ce{H2} gas ($P_{H2}$ = \hl{XXX}) to show the stability of the cluster. The second set of conditions is activation conditions, with temperatures around $T = 200 ^{o}C$ and pressures around \hl{5\% H2 in 95\% (cite all the articles that activate with H2)}.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Phase diagram which show both T and PH2 that contains the correct structures. 
        \item Selecting a set of conditions and plotting the free energy of those structures along a set of conditions (think back to the line plots shown). Can generate the line plots at different conditions --> and then can use boltzmann weighting to determine the fraction of those structures at those conditions... 
        \item the most relevant structures that should be included on the diagram for this step. 
        \item need to select a partial pressure of H2O, which we will select as 10-10 to 10-15 because this is about the pressure for UHV..and I can plot the variation of this assumption in the SI for the paper to show. 
        \item Last statement..which will show in the SI a structure that contains the full cluster stripped away from MOFs... the phase diagram show the transformation of all Ni atoms away from the cluster

%\begin{itemize}
%    \item The structure of \ce{Cu3(OH)4} complex is altered depending on the gas %phase conditions. The phase diagram for \ce{Cu3(OH)4} shows the formation of %physisorbed \ce{H2O} and \ce{Cu-H} species due to the adsorption and dissociation %of \ce{H2}. 
%    \begin{itemize}
%        \item The physisorbed \ce{H2O} species are formed by converting one of the %\ce{OH}-ligands in the cluster. The additional proton is from the adsorption %of the gas phase \ce{H2}. For \ce{Cu(OH)4}, the structure contains 4 %\ce{OH}-ligands that link the \ce{Cu} atoms across the c-pore. Figure %\ref{fig:phasediagramCu3} c) shows the the physisorbed \ce{H2O} and the %\ce{OH}-ligand replacement with an \ce{H} atom. Figure %\ref{fig:phasediagramCu3} shows how as the gas phase \ce{H2O} decreases, the %weakly bound \ce{H2O} molecule ( \ref{fig:structurediagramCu3} c)) desorbs %from the cluster (\ref{fig:structurediagramCu3} b)).
%        \item The \ce{Cu-H} species form when again by the dissociation of \ce{H2} on %the cluster. The phase diagram shows that as \ce{H2O} forms, the site %previously occupied by the \ce{OH}-ligand now contains the metal hydride %(\ce{Cu-H}). Interestingly, the metal hydrides that form 'bridge' two \ce{Cu} %atoms. Both \ref{fig:structurediagramCu3} a), b), and c) show the bridging %\ce{Cu-H-Cu} structures.
%    \end{itemize}
%    \item \ce{H2} partial pressure and \ce{H2O} partial pressure are important in the %structural stability. 
%    \begin{itemize}
%        \item The \ce{H2O} partial pressure can be used to inhibit the dissociative %adsorption of \ce{H2} (orange region on Figure \ref{fig:phasediagramCu3}).
%        \item As \ce{H2O} partial pressure decreases when exposed to \ce{H2}, the %cluster is reduced.
%    \end{itemize}
%    \item The two reduced structures (on Figure \ref{fig:phasediagramCu3} and Figure %\ref{fig:structurediagramCu3}) are \ce{(CuHCuHCu)} and \ce{(CuCu)(Cu)}. Both %structures show the conversion and removal of all \ce{OH}-ligands.
%    \begin{itemize}
%        \item \ce{(CuHCuHCu)} shows the complete reduction of \ce{Cu} and presence of %\ce{Cu-H-Cu} bridging structures. The bond distance seems too large for any %\ce{Cu-Cu} metallic bonds.  
%        \item \ce{(CuCu)(Cu)} shows the formation of a metallic \ce{Cu-Cu} bond (as %indicated by the 2.37 A. The \ce{Cu} atoms are not completely reduced, rather %exist as \ce{Cu(0)}, \ce{Cu(I)}, and \ce{Cu(I)}. This structure is %particularly interesting because it shows the formation of the mobile %\ce{Cu(0)} species. 
%    \end{itemize}
%    \item We are performing additional calculation that contains two mononuclear %(single-site) \ce{Cu} sites on both nodes in the c-pore with the middle \ce{Cu} %atom being removed. 
%\end{itemize}
%
%\begin{itemize}
%    \item structures a) and d) both generate the more mobile species.. structure a) %contained Cu-H-Cu bridge structures whereas d) generates Cu-Cu metal bonds.
%    \item structures b) and c) are analogous structures, except the partial pressure %of \ce{H2O} is sufficiently high, which can be used to prevent the desorption of %\ce{H2O} on the cluster. Both structures show the replacement of a hydroxo ligand %has been replaced with a metal hydride. For the multinuclear clusters, these %metal hydride structures are common.

%
%Figure \ref{fig:phasediagramNi4} shows the stability of the \ce{Ni4(OH)6} metal %complex under different hydrogenation conditions. As the partial pressure of \ce{H2} %increase (a more positive chemical potential) under ambient conditions, the %\ce{OH}-ligands within the \ce{Ni4(OH)6} metal complex are converted into physisorbed %\ce{H2O} through the dissociative adsorption of \ce{H2} onto the cluster. Increasing %the gas phase \ce{H2} partial pressure, increases the driving force for dissociative %adsorption. However, if the partial pressure of \ce{H2O} in the gas phase is too %large, the desorption of weakly bound \ce{H2O} molecules is prevented (as shown in %Figures \ref{fig:phasediagramNi4} and \ref{fig:structurediagramNi4}). Additionally, %\textit{ab initio} thermodynamic analysis suggests that at high enough partial %pressure of both \ce{H2O} and \ce{H2} that the cluster can exhibit both physisorbed %waters and metal hydride structures.
% 
%
%%At sufficient gas phase \ce{H2} partial pressures (e.g.\ log %$\frac{P_{\ce{H2}}}{P^{o}_{\ce{H2}}}=-1$ at \SI{200}{\celsius}), the cluster exhibits %dynamic structural changes in both morphology and composition. The changes show the %breakdown of the Ni(II) metal complex. Specifically, the the \ce{OH}-ligands are %systematically replaced by \ce{H} atoms that are forming metal hydride species. The %replacement of these \ce{OH}-ligands is clearly demonstrated in Figure %\ref{fig:structurediagramNi4}. These structural changes are further illustrated by %the reduction in the oxidation state of \ce{Ni} and the decreasing distance between %\ce{Ni} atoms (Table \ref{tbl:Ni4oxidationstates}).

%%The replacement of structural \ce{OH}-ligands with \ce{H} atoms, the decreasing of %\ce{Ni} oxidation state, and the decreasing \ce{Ni-Ni} distances all suggests that %under these reducing conditions the \ce{Ni(II)} metal complex is no longer stable. %That is, thermodynamically, under these conditions the metal atoms of the supported %metal complex are being liberated, suggesting that the formation of \ce{Ni} %nanoparticles is favorable in this regime.

%\begin{itemize}
%    \item The \ce{Ni4(OH)6} phase diagram is structurally more diverse than the %\ce{Cu3(OH)4} phase diagram (attributed to more metal and \ce{OH}-ligands in the %\ce{Ni} metal complex). However, there are similar features as the \ce{Cu3(OH)4 %}(\ref{fig:phasediagramCu3}). Both demonstrate metal hydrides, and physisorbed %\ce{H2O}.
%    \item The presence of \ce{H2O} in the gas phase has a strong influence over the %structurally stability. For example, at \ce{H2} partial pressure of ~ $10^-1$ %bar, the reduction of the cluster is illustrated going from \ce{Ni2(NiH)2(OH)4} %to \ce{(NiH2Ni)(NiNi)}. At higher \ce{H2O} partial pressure, the cluster is more %likely to exist as a combination of \ce{Ni-H} and physisorbed \ce{H2O}. As the %partial pressure of \ce{H2O} decreases, the formed physisorbed \ce{H2O} is %removed. Overall, if the cluster is exposed to a sufficient \ce{H2} gas the %cluster is reduced. 
%    \item The main structures to focus on are the structures that demonstrate the %\ce{Ni} reduction from \ce{Ni(II)} to \ce{Ni(0)}. These structures reveal the %presence of metallic \ce{Ni} bonds (the more mobile species).

%% Discussion
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\newpage
\subsection{Discussion}
The \ce{Ni(II)} metal complex structure is dependent on the environment. In the absence of any \ce{H2}, the cluster contains four \ce{Ni(II)} atoms interconnected by \ce{OH}-ligands as suggested by \hl{REFERENCE Platero-Prats}. The tetranuclear configuration of the \ce{Ni(II)} cluster spans the c-pore of the NU-1000 framework. When exposed to \ce{H2} gas, the \ce{OH}-ligands provide sites for \ce{H} adsorption onto the cluster resulting in the formation of \ce{H2O}.  \hl{HIGHLIGHT THE SINTERING PAPER} investigate \ce{H2} adsorption and dissociation on a single \ce{Ni} atom also supported on NU-1000, finding that barriers for \ce{H2} adsorption and dissociation and removal of \ce{H2O} are 141 $kJ/mol$. However within our work, we do not look at the kinetics of \ce{H2} adsorption and dissociation and the subsequent removal of \ce{H2O}. Our discussion focuses on the equilibrium thermodynamic structure resulting from exposure to \ce{H2} gas at different partial pressure and temperatures.

% Paragraph on the breakdown of the chain structures and then suggestions on where those Ni atoms compared to the Cu atoms that form 

% Paragraph on the kinetic restraints

\begin{itemize}
    \item The structural characteristics of the supported metal complexes are dependent on the reaction conditions.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item In the presence of a reducing agent (\ce{H2}), the hydroxo-ligands of the supported metal complexes are removed (as \ce{H2O}). As previously suggested, we show computationally that \ce{H2} is important in breaking the bonds between the metal clusters and the NU-1000 nodes. We provide the thermodynamic landscape for these transformations.
        \item Our findings show similar structural features and suggest that in an \ce{H2} reducing environment these supported metal complexes containing \ce{OH}-ligands are not stable.  
        \item At present, our modeling efforts demonstrate the formation of the more mobile \ce{M(0)} species. The breakdown of the supported metal complex (removal of \ce{OH}-ligands within the cluster) reduces the metal atoms, thereby generating the mobile \ce{M(0)} species.
    \end{itemize}
    \item A key question that still remains is whether these reduced supported metal complexes still exist as a combination of NPs and multinuclear metal active sites or mononuclear active sites (single-sites) above \SI{200}{Celsius}.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \citeauthor{Halder2020} determined that in an \ce{H2} environment the \ce{Cu3(OH)4} supported metal complexes showed large \ce{Cu} NP formation. These particles were ~6.0 nm in diameter, which is larger than the ~3.0 nm diameter hexagonal pore in NU-1000. Therefore, for \ce{Cu}-NU-1000 we know that these NPs grow, and we show using our modeling that for \ce{Ni} we expect \ce{Ni} NPs to grow as well. 
        \item Our present results support the experimental findings of \citeauthor{Halder2020} that reduced metal atoms are generated. However, we extend the findings further and hypothesize that some of the single-site metal atoms remain intact. Not all of the metal atoms are reduced to \ce{M(0)}; the metal atoms attached to the \ce{OH}-ligands of the node remain. 
        \item There are a few more additional calculations to be computed to test our theory (and these calculations are currently being performed). The calculations contain two single-site models (with and without the \ce{M-H} species). The metal atoms removed from the system will be accounted for as nanoclusters.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
We have the following list of questions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Experimentally, there is a different in the protocols to generate the single-site and the clusters in NU-1000? Experimentally, you can differentiate between the two different catalysts in NU-1000? 
    \item When looking at the Cu-NU-1000 discussion, did you ever remove the Cu-NPs and determine whether the framework that was left behind was catalytically active? We wonder whether or not all the metal atoms are becoming the mobile \ce{M(0)} species. 
    \item The hexagonal pore returned to its original ~34 A value. How does the value of the pore compare when there are single-site metal atoms attached to the node? 
\end{itemize}

%\subsection{References}

%The class makes various changes to the way that references are
%handled.  The class loads \textsf{natbib}, and also the
%appropriate bibliography style.  References can be made using
%the normal method; the citation should be placed before any
%punctuation, as the class will move it if using a superscript
%citation style
%\cite{Mena2000,Abernethy2003,Friedman-Hill2003,EuropeanCommission2008}.
%The use of \textsf{natbib} allows the use of the various citation
%commands of that package: \citeauthor{Abernethy2003} have shown
%something, in \citeyear{Cotton1999}, or as given by
%Ref.~\citenum{Mena2000}.  Long lists of authors will be
%automatically truncated in most article formats, but not in
%supplementary information or reviews \cite{Pople2003}. If you
%encounter problems with the citation macros, please check that
%your copy of \textsf{natbib} is up to date. The demonstration
%database file \texttt{achemso-demo.bib} shows how to complete
%entries correctly. Notice that ``\latin{et al.}'' is auto-formatted
%using the \texttt{\textbackslash latin} command.

%Multiple citations to be combined into a list can be %given as
%a single citation.  This uses the \textsf{mciteplus} %package
%\cite{Johnson1972,*Arduengo1992,*Eisenstein2005,*Arduengo%1994}.
%Citations other than the first of the list should be %indicated
%with a star. If the \textsf{mciteplus} package is not %installed,
%the standard bibliography tools will still work but %starred
%references will be ignored. Individual references can be %referred
%to using \texttt{\textbackslash mciteSubRef}:
%``ref.~\mciteSubRef{Eisenstein2005}''.

%The class also handles notes to be added to the bibliography.  These
%should be given in place in the document \bibnote{This is a note.
%The text will be moved the the references section.  The title of the
%section will change to ``Notes and References''.}.  As with
%citations, the text should be placed before punctuation.  A note is
%also generated if a citation has an optional note.  This assumes that
%the whole work has already been cited: odd numbering will result if
%this is not the case \cite[p.~1]{Cotton1999}.
