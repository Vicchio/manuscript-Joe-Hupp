   abstract = {The reactivity of heterogeneous metal catalysts can be a strong function of the coverage of adsorbates. For example, Pt-catalyzed NO oxidation to NO2 requires high concentrations of chemisorbed (surface-bound) O, but the development of surface oxides is detrimental to reaction kinetics. Quantifying the structures, properties, and especially the conditions that produce various adsorbate coverages is essential to developing qualitatively and quantitatively correct models of surface reactivity. In this work, we examine these ideas in the context of oxidation reactions on Pt(111), the lowest energy face of bulk Pt. We use extensive supercell density functional theory (DFT) calculations to catalog and characterize the stable binding sites and arrangements of chemisorbed O on Pt(111), as a function of O coverage, θ. O atoms are found to uniformly prefer FCC binding sites and to arrange to minimize various destabilizing interactions with neighbor O. These destabilizing interactions are shown to have electronic and strain components that can either reinforce or oppose one another depending upon O - O separation. Because of the nature and magnitudes of these lateral interactions, the thermodynamically stable O orderings partition into four coverage regimes of decreasing adsorption energy: 0 < θ ≤ 1/4 monolayer (ML), 1/4 < θ ≤ 1/2 ML, 1/2 < θ ≤ 2/3 ML, and 2/3 < θ ≤ 1 ML. We use equilibrium models to quantify the oxygen chemical potentials μO necessary to access each of these regimes. These equilibrium models can be used to relate surface coverage to various external environmental conditions and assumptions about relevant reaction equilibria: dissociative equilibrium of the surface with O2 (g) can produce coverages up to 1/2 ML; either NO2 decomposition or "NO-assisted" O2 dissociation can access coverages approaching 2/3 ML, as observed during NO oxidation catalysis, and equilibrium with a solidoxygen storage material, like ceria-zirconia, can buffer equilibrium coverages at a constant 1/4 ML O. These various oxidation reaction energies can be summarized in a single "Ellingham" free energy diagram, providing a convenient representation of the relationship between surface coverage and reaction thermodynamics, and a useful guide toward relevant coverage regimes for more detailed study of reaction kinetics. © 2008 American Chemical Society.},

   abstract = {A periodic density functional theory study complemented by ab initio thermodynamic analysis was carried out to identify the active sites and mechanism of selective oxidation of methane to methanol in Cu/ZSM-5 catalysts. We systematically analyzed structure and stability of a wide range of potential extra-framework Cu complexes in ZSM-5 to address Cu speciation in realistic zeolite materials. We demonstrate that depending on the conditions of catalyst activation, binuclear [Cu(μ-O)Cu] 2+ species and trinuclear oxygenated [Cu 3 (μ-O) 3 ] 2+ clusters can preferentially be stabilized in ZSM-5. The trinuclear Cu sites are the most stable extra-framework Cu species in Cu/ZSM-5 activated by calcination, whereas the formation of the binuclear complexes is favored under O 2 -poor atmosphere. Although both types of Cu complexes contain extra-framework O -, radical species necessary for the homolytic C-H bond cleavage, the reaction paths for methane conversion that they provide are drastically different. Binuclear Cu sites react with CH 4 stoichiometrically to yield methoxy groups strongly bound in the zeolite micropores. In contrast, the trinuclear [Cu 3 (μ-O) 3 ] 2+ cluster favors the direct conversion of CH 4 to CH 3 OH coordinated with the partially reduced Cu complex. These computational findings point to the trinuclear Cu-oxo clusters in ZSM-5 as the potential candidates for promotion of the low temperature direct conversion of CH 4 to CH 3 OH.},

   abstract = {Alumina supported Pt nanoclusters under a hydrogen environment play a crucial role in many heterogeneous catalysis applications. We conducted grand canonical genetic algorithm simulations for supported Pt8 clusters in a hydrogen gas environment to study the intracluster, cluster-support, and cluster-adsorbate interactions. Two alumina surfaces, α-Al2O3(0001) and γ-Al2O3(100), and two conditions, T = 600 °C, pH2 = 0.1 bar and T = 25 °C, pH2 = 1.0 bar, were considered corresponding to low and high hydrogen chemical potential μH, respectively. The low free energy ensemble of Pt8 is decorated by a medium (2-12 H), respectively, high (20-30 H), number of hydrogen atoms under equilibrium at low μH, respectively, high μH, and undergoes different morphological transformations on the two surfaces. On α-Al2O3(0001), Pt8 is mostly 3D but very fluxional in structure at low μH and converts to open one-layer 2D structures with minimal fluxionality at high μH, whereas on γ-Al2O3(100), the exact opposite occurs: Pt8 clusters present one-layer 2D shapes at low μH and switch to compact 3D shapes under high μH, during which the Pt8 cluster preserves moderate fluxionality. Further analysis reveals a similar Pt-Pt bond length increase when switching from low μH to high μH on both surfaces although morphological transformations are different. Electronic structure analysis shows the existence of bonding interactions between Pt and Lewis acidic Al3+ sites along with the Pt-O interaction, which implies the necessity to include Al neighbors to discuss the electronic structure of small Pt clusters.},

   abstract = {The relationships among the macroscopic compositional parameters of a Cu-exchanged SSZ-13 zeolite catalyst, the types and numbers of Cu active sites, and activity for the selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NOx with NH3 are established through experimental interrogation and computational analysis of materials across the catalyst composition space. Density functional theory, stochastic models, and experimental characterizations demonstrate that within the synthesis protocols applied here and across Si:Al ratios, the volumetric density of six-membered-rings (6MR) containing two Al (2Al sites) is consistent with a random Al siting in the SSZ-13 lattice subject to Löwensteins rule. Further, exchanged CuII ions first populate these 2Al sites before populating remaining unpaired, or 1Al, sites as CuIIOH. These sites are distinguished and enumerated ex situ through vibrational and X-ray absorption spectroscopies (XAS) and chemical titrations. In situ and operando XAS follow Cu oxidation state and coordination environment as a function of environmental conditions including low-temperature (473 K) SCR catalysis and are rationalized through first-principles thermodynamics and ab initio molecular dynamics. Experiment and theory together reveal that the Cu sites respond sensitively to exposure conditions, and in particular that Cu species are solvated and mobilized by NH3 under SCR conditions. While Cu sites are spectroscopically and chemically distinct away from these conditions, they exhibit similar turnover rates, apparent activation energies and apparent reaction orders at the SCR conditions, even on zeolite frameworks other than SSZ13.},

Its open-source implementation in Python leverages existing scientific codes, encourages users to write scripts for their needs, and allows the code to be expanded easily. The core classes developed include a statistical mechanical model in which energy modes can be included or excluded to suit the application, empirical models for rapid thermodynamic property estimation, and a reaction model to calculate kinetic parameters or changes in thermodynamic properties. In addition, pMuTT supports other features, such as Brønsted-Evans-Polanyi (BEP) relationships, coverage effects, and ab-initio phase diagrams.

   abstract = {A new density functional (DF) of the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) type for general chemistry applications termed B97-D is proposed. It is based on Becke's power-series ansatz from 1997 and is explicitly parameterized by including damped atom-pairwise dispersion corrections of the form C 6 · R-6. A general computational scheme for the parameters used in this correction has been established and parameters for elements up to xenon and a scaling factor for the dispersion part for several common density functionals (BLYP, PBE, TPSS, B3LYP) are reported. The new functional is tested in comparison with other GGAs and the B3LYP hybrid functional on standard thermochemical benchmark sets, for 40 noncovalently bound complexes, including large stacked aromatic molecules and group II element clusters, and for the computation of molecular geometries. Further cross-validation tests were performed for organometallic reactions and other difficult problems for standard functionals. In summary, it is found that B97-D belongs to one of the most accurate general purpose GGAs, reaching, for example for the G97/2 set of heat of formations, a mean absolute deviation of only 3.8 kcal mol-1. The performance for noncovalently bound systems including many pure van der Waals complexes is exceptionally good, reaching on the average CCSD(T) accuracy. The basic strategy in the development to restrict the density functional description to shorter electron correlation lengths scales and to describe situations with medium to large interatomic distances by damped C6 · R-6 terms seems to be very successful, as demonstrated for some notoriously difficult reactions. As an example, for the isomerization of larger branched to linear alkanes, B97-D is the only DF available that yields the right sign for the energy difference. From a practical point of view, the new functional seems to be quite robust and it is thus suggested as an efficient and accurate quantum chemical method for large systems where dispersion forces are of general importance. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

   abstract = {Generalized gradient approximations (GGA's) for the exchange-correlation energy improve upon the local spin density (LSD) description of atoms, molecules, and solids. We present a simple derivation of a simple GGA, in which all parameters (other than those in LSD) are fundamental constants. Only general features of the detailed construction underlying the Perdew-Wang 1991 (PW91) GGA are invoked. Improvements over PW91 include an accurate description of the linear response of the uniform electron gas, correct behavior under uniform scaling, and a smoother potential. [S0031-9007(96)01479-2] PACS numbers: 71.15.Mb, 71.45.Gm Kohn-Sham density functional theory [1,2] is widely used for self-consistent-field electronic structure calculations of the ground-state properties of atoms, molecules, and solids. In this theory, only the exchange-correlation energy E XC E X 1 E C as a functional of the electron spin densities n " r and n # r must be approximated. The most popular functionals have a form appropriate for slowly varying densities: the local spin density (LSD) approximation E LSD XC n " , n # Z d 3 r ne unif XC n " , n # , (1) where n n " 1 n # , and the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) [3,4] E GGA XC n " , n # Z d 3 r fn " , n # , =n " , =n #. (2) In comparison with LSD, GGA's tend to improve total energies [4], atomization energies [4-6], energy barriers and structural energy differences [7-9]. GGA's expand and soften bonds [6], an effect that sometimes corrects [10] and sometimes overcorrects [11] the LSD prediction. Typically, GGA's favor density inhomogeneity more than LSD does. To facilitate practical calculations, e unif XC and f must be parametrized analytic functions. The exchange-correlation energy per particle of a uniform electron gas, e unif XC n " , n # , is well established [12], but the best choice for fn " , n # , =n " , =n # is still a matter of debate. Judging the derivations and formal properties of various GGA's can guide a rational choice among them. Semiempirical GGA's can be remarkably successful for small molecules, but fail for delocalized electrons in the uniform gas [when fn " , n # , 0, 0 fi ne unif XC n " , n # ] and thus in simple metals. A first-principles numerical GGA can be constructed [13] by starting from the second-order density-gradient expansion for the exchange-correlation hole surrounding the electron in a system of slowly varying density, then cutting off its spurious long-range parts to satisfy sum rules on the exact hole. The Perdew-Wang 1991 (PW91) [14] functional is an analytic fit to this numerical GGA, designed to satisfy several further exact conditions [13]. PW91 incorporates some inhomogeneity effects while retaining many of the best features of LSD, but has its own problems: (1) The derivation is long, and depends on a mass of detail. (2) The analytic function f, fitted to the numerical results of the real-space cutoff, is complicated and nontransparent. (3) f is overparametrized. (4) The parameters are not seamlessly joined [15], leading to spurious wiggles in the exchange-correlation potential dE XC dn s r for small [16] and large [16,17] dimension-less density gradients, which can bedevil the construction of GGA-based electron-ion pseudopotentials [18-20]. (5) Although the numerical GGA correlation energy functional behaves properly [13] under Levy's uniform scaling to the high-density limit [21], its analytic parametrization (PW91) does not [22]. (6) Because PW91 reduces to the second-order gradient expansion for density variations that are either slowly varying or small, it descibes the linear response of the density of a uniform electron gas less satisfactorily than does LSD [20,23]. This last problem illustrates a fact which is often overlooked: The semilocal form of Eq. (2) is too restrictive to reproduce all the known behaviors of the exact functional [13]. In contrast to the construction of the PW91 functional, which was designed to satisfy as many exact conditions as possible, the GGA presented here satisfies only those which are energetically significant. For example , in the pseudopotential theory of simple metals, the linear-response limit is physically important. On the other hand, recovery of the exact second-order gradient expansion in the slowly varying limit makes little difference to the energies of real systems. We solve the 6 problems above with a simple new derivation of a simple new GGA functional in which all parameters [other than those in e unif XC n " , n # ] are fundamental constants. Although the derivation depends only on the most general features of the real-space construction [13] behind PW91, the resulting functional is close to numerical GGA.

Because of this property, the application of the nonlocal part of the pseudopotential to a wave function can be done efficiently on a grid in real space. Real space integration is much faster for large systems than ordinary multiplication in Fourier space, since it shows only quadratic scaling with respect to the size of the system.

   abstract = {The method of dispersion correction as an add-on to standard Kohn-Sham density functional theory (DFT-D) has been refined regarding higher accuracy, broader range of applicability, and less empiricism. The main new ingredients are atom-pairwise specific dispersion coefficients and cutoff radii that are both computed from first principles. The coefficients for new eighth-order dispersion terms are computed using established recursion relations. System (geometry) dependent information is used for the first time in a DFT-D type approach by employing the new concept of fractional coordination numbers (CN). They are used to interpolate between dispersion coefficients of atoms in different chemical environments. The method only requires adjustment of two global parameters for each density functional, is asymptotically exact for a gas of weakly interacting neutral atoms, and easily allows the computation of atomic forces. Three-body nonadditivity terms are considered. The method has been assessed on standard benchmark sets for inter- and intramolecular noncovalent interactions with a particular emphasis on a consistent description of light and heavy element systems. The mean absolute deviations for the S22 benchmark set of noncovalent interactions for 11 standard density functionals decrease by 15\%-40\% compared to the previous (already accurate) DFT-D version. Spectacular improvements are found for a tripeptide-folding model and all tested metallic systems. The rectification of the long-range behavior and the use of more accurate C6 coefficients also lead to a much better description of large (infinite) systems as shown for graphene sheets and the adsorption of benzene on an Ag(111) surface. For graphene it is found that the inclusion of three-body terms substantially (by about 10\%) weakens the interlayer binding. We propose the revised DFT-D method as a general tool for the computation of the dispersion energy in molecules and solids of any kind with DFT and related (low-cost) electronic structure methods for large systems. © 2010 American Institute of Physics.},

   abstract = {The metal-organic framework (MOF), NU-1000, and its metalated counterparts have found proof-of-concept application in heterogeneous catalysis and hydrogen storage among others. A vapor-phase technique, akin to atomic layer deposition (ALD), is used to selectively deposit divalent Cu ions on oxo, hydroxo-bridged hexa-zirconium(IV) nodes capped with terminal -OH and -OH2 ligands. The subsequent reaction with steam yields node-anchored, CuII-oxo, hydroxo clusters. We find that cluster installation via AIM (ALD in MOFs) is accompanied by an expansion of the MOF mesopore (channel) diameter. We investigated the behavior of the cluster-modified material, termed Cu-AIM-NU-1000, to heat treatment up to 325 °C at atmospheric pressure with a low flow of H2 into the reaction cell. The response under these conditions revealed two important results: (1) Above 200 °C, the initially installed few-metal-ion clusters reduce to neutral Cu atoms. The neutral atoms migrate from the nodes and aggregate into Cu nanoparticles. While the size of particles formed in the MOF interior is constrained by the width of mesopores (∼3 nm), the size of those formed on the exterior surface of the MOF can grow as large as ∼8 nm. (2) Reduction and release of Cu atoms from the MOFs nodes is accompanied by the dynamic structural transformation of NU-1000 as it reverts back to its original dimension following the release. These results show that while the MOF framework itself remains intact at 325 °C in an H2 atmosphere, the small, AIM-installed CuII-oxo, hydroxo clusters are stable with respect to reduction and conversion to metallic nanoparticles only up to ∼200 °C.},
