   abstract = {The reactivity of heterogeneous metal catalysts can be a strong function of the coverage of adsorbates. For example, Pt-catalyzed NO oxidation to NO2 requires high concentrations of chemisorbed (surface-bound) O, but the development of surface oxides is detrimental to reaction kinetics. Quantifying the structures, properties, and especially the conditions that produce various adsorbate coverages is essential to developing qualitatively and quantitatively correct models of surface reactivity. In this work, we examine these ideas in the context of oxidation reactions on Pt(111), the lowest energy face of bulk Pt. We use extensive supercell density functional theory (DFT) calculations to catalog and characterize the stable binding sites and arrangements of chemisorbed O on Pt(111), as a function of O coverage, θ. O atoms are found to uniformly prefer FCC binding sites and to arrange to minimize various destabilizing interactions with neighbor O. These destabilizing interactions are shown to have electronic and strain components that can either reinforce or oppose one another depending upon O - O separation. Because of the nature and magnitudes of these lateral interactions, the thermodynamically stable O orderings partition into four coverage regimes of decreasing adsorption energy: 0 < θ ≤ 1/4 monolayer (ML), 1/4 < θ ≤ 1/2 ML, 1/2 < θ ≤ 2/3 ML, and 2/3 < θ ≤ 1 ML. We use equilibrium models to quantify the oxygen chemical potentials μO necessary to access each of these regimes. These equilibrium models can be used to relate surface coverage to various external environmental conditions and assumptions about relevant reaction equilibria: dissociative equilibrium of the surface with O2 (g) can produce coverages up to 1/2 ML; either NO2 decomposition or "NO-assisted" O2 dissociation can access coverages approaching 2/3 ML, as observed during NO oxidation catalysis, and equilibrium with a solidoxygen storage material, like ceria-zirconia, can buffer equilibrium coverages at a constant 1/4 ML O. These various oxidation reaction energies can be summarized in a single "Ellingham" free energy diagram, providing a convenient representation of the relationship between surface coverage and reaction thermodynamics, and a useful guide toward relevant coverage regimes for more detailed study of reaction kinetics. © 2008 American Chemical Society.},

   abstract = {A periodic density functional theory study complemented by ab initio thermodynamic analysis was carried out to identify the active sites and mechanism of selective oxidation of methane to methanol in Cu/ZSM-5 catalysts. We systematically analyzed structure and stability of a wide range of potential extra-framework Cu complexes in ZSM-5 to address Cu speciation in realistic zeolite materials. We demonstrate that depending on the conditions of catalyst activation, binuclear [Cu(μ-O)Cu] 2+ species and trinuclear oxygenated [Cu 3 (μ-O) 3 ] 2+ clusters can preferentially be stabilized in ZSM-5. The trinuclear Cu sites are the most stable extra-framework Cu species in Cu/ZSM-5 activated by calcination, whereas the formation of the binuclear complexes is favored under O 2 -poor atmosphere. Although both types of Cu complexes contain extra-framework O -, radical species necessary for the homolytic C-H bond cleavage, the reaction paths for methane conversion that they provide are drastically different. Binuclear Cu sites react with CH 4 stoichiometrically to yield methoxy groups strongly bound in the zeolite micropores. In contrast, the trinuclear [Cu 3 (μ-O) 3 ] 2+ cluster favors the direct conversion of CH 4 to CH 3 OH coordinated with the partially reduced Cu complex. These computational findings point to the trinuclear Cu-oxo clusters in ZSM-5 as the potential candidates for promotion of the low temperature direct conversion of CH 4 to CH 3 OH.},

   abstract = {Alumina supported Pt nanoclusters under a hydrogen environment play a crucial role in many heterogeneous catalysis applications. We conducted grand canonical genetic algorithm simulations for supported Pt8 clusters in a hydrogen gas environment to study the intracluster, cluster-support, and cluster-adsorbate interactions. Two alumina surfaces, α-Al2O3(0001) and γ-Al2O3(100), and two conditions, T = 600 °C, pH2 = 0.1 bar and T = 25 °C, pH2 = 1.0 bar, were considered corresponding to low and high hydrogen chemical potential μH, respectively. The low free energy ensemble of Pt8 is decorated by a medium (2-12 H), respectively, high (20-30 H), number of hydrogen atoms under equilibrium at low μH, respectively, high μH, and undergoes different morphological transformations on the two surfaces. On α-Al2O3(0001), Pt8 is mostly 3D but very fluxional in structure at low μH and converts to open one-layer 2D structures with minimal fluxionality at high μH, whereas on γ-Al2O3(100), the exact opposite occurs: Pt8 clusters present one-layer 2D shapes at low μH and switch to compact 3D shapes under high μH, during which the Pt8 cluster preserves moderate fluxionality. Further analysis reveals a similar Pt-Pt bond length increase when switching from low μH to high μH on both surfaces although morphological transformations are different. Electronic structure analysis shows the existence of bonding interactions between Pt and Lewis acidic Al3+ sites along with the Pt-O interaction, which implies the necessity to include Al neighbors to discuss the electronic structure of small Pt clusters.},

   abstract = {The relationships among the macroscopic compositional parameters of a Cu-exchanged SSZ-13 zeolite catalyst, the types and numbers of Cu active sites, and activity for the selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NOx with NH3 are established through experimental interrogation and computational analysis of materials across the catalyst composition space. Density functional theory, stochastic models, and experimental characterizations demonstrate that within the synthesis protocols applied here and across Si:Al ratios, the volumetric density of six-membered-rings (6MR) containing two Al (2Al sites) is consistent with a random Al siting in the SSZ-13 lattice subject to Löwensteins rule. Further, exchanged CuII ions first populate these 2Al sites before populating remaining unpaired, or 1Al, sites as CuIIOH. These sites are distinguished and enumerated ex situ through vibrational and X-ray absorption spectroscopies (XAS) and chemical titrations. In situ and operando XAS follow Cu oxidation state and coordination environment as a function of environmental conditions including low-temperature (473 K) SCR catalysis and are rationalized through first-principles thermodynamics and ab initio molecular dynamics. Experiment and theory together reveal that the Cu sites respond sensitively to exposure conditions, and in particular that Cu species are solvated and mobilized by NH3 under SCR conditions. While Cu sites are spectroscopically and chemically distinct away from these conditions, they exhibit similar turnover rates, apparent activation energies and apparent reaction orders at the SCR conditions, even on zeolite frameworks other than SSZ13.},

Its open-source implementation in Python leverages existing scientific codes, encourages users to write scripts for their needs, and allows the code to be expanded easily. The core classes developed include a statistical mechanical model in which energy modes can be included or excluded to suit the application, empirical models for rapid thermodynamic property estimation, and a reaction model to calculate kinetic parameters or changes in thermodynamic properties.

   abstract = {A new density functional (DF) of the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) type for general chemistry applications termed B97-D is proposed. It is based on Becke's power-series ansatz from 1997 and is explicitly parameterized by including damped atom-pairwise dispersion corrections of the form C 6 · R-6. A general computational scheme for the parameters used in this correction has been established and parameters for elements up to xenon and a scaling factor for the dispersion part for several common density functionals (BLYP, PBE, TPSS, B3LYP) are reported. The new functional is tested in comparison with other GGAs and the B3LYP hybrid functional on standard thermochemical benchmark sets, for 40 noncovalently bound complexes, including large stacked aromatic molecules and group II element clusters, and for the computation of molecular geometries. Further cross-validation tests were performed for organometallic reactions and other difficult problems for standard functionals. In summary, it is found that B97-D belongs to one of the most accurate general purpose GGAs, reaching, for example for the G97/2 set of heat of formations, a mean absolute deviation of only 3.8 kcal mol-1. The performance for noncovalently bound systems including many pure van der Waals complexes is exceptionally good, reaching on the average CCSD(T) accuracy. The basic strategy in the development to restrict the density functional description to shorter electron correlation lengths scales and to describe situations with medium to large interatomic distances by damped C6 · R-6 terms seems to be very successful, as demonstrated for some notoriously difficult reactions. As an example, for the isomerization of larger branched to linear alkanes, B97-D is the only DF available that yields the right sign for the energy difference. From a practical point of view, the new functional seems to be quite robust and it is thus suggested as an efficient and accurate quantum chemical method for large systems where dispersion forces are of general importance. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

   abstract = {Generalized gradient approximations (GGA's) for the exchange-correlation energy improve upon the local spin density (LSD) description of atoms, molecules, and solids. We present a simple derivation of a simple GGA, in which all parameters (other than those in LSD) are fundamental constants. Only general features of the detailed construction underlying the Perdew-Wang 1991 (PW91) GGA are invoked. Improvements over PW91 include an accurate description of the linear response of the uniform electron gas, correct behavior under uniform scaling, and a smoother potential. [S0031-9007(96)01479-2] PACS numbers: 71.15.Mb, 71.45.Gm Kohn-Sham density functional theory [1,2] is widely used for self-consistent-field electronic structure calculations of the ground-state properties of atoms, molecules, and solids. In this theory, only the exchange-correlation energy E XC E X 1 E C as a functional of the electron spin densities n " r and n # r must be approximated. The most popular functionals have a form appropriate for slowly varying densities: the local spin density (LSD) approximation E LSD XC n " , n # Z d 3 r ne unif XC n " , n # , (1) where n n " 1 n # , and the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) [3,4] E GGA XC n " , n # Z d 3 r fn " , n # , =n " , =n #. (2) In comparison with LSD, GGA's tend to improve total energies [4], atomization energies [4-6], energy barriers and structural energy differences [7-9]. GGA's expand and soften bonds [6], an effect that sometimes corrects [10] and sometimes overcorrects [11] the LSD prediction. Typically, GGA's favor density inhomogeneity more than LSD does. To facilitate practical calculations, e unif XC and f must be parametrized analytic functions. The exchange-correlation energy per particle of a uniform electron gas, e unif XC n " , n # , is well established [12], but the best choice for fn " , n # , =n " , =n # is still a matter of debate. Judging the derivations and formal properties of various GGA's can guide a rational choice among them. Semiempirical GGA's can be remarkably successful for small molecules, but fail for delocalized electrons in the uniform gas [when fn " , n # , 0, 0 fi ne unif XC n " , n # ] and thus in simple metals. A first-principles numerical GGA can be constructed [13] by starting from the second-order density-gradient expansion for the exchange-correlation hole surrounding the electron in a system of slowly varying density, then cutting off its spurious long-range parts to satisfy sum rules on the exact hole. The Perdew-Wang 1991 (PW91) [14] functional is an analytic fit to this numerical GGA, designed to satisfy several further exact conditions [13]. PW91 incorporates some inhomogeneity effects while retaining many of the best features of LSD, but has its own problems: (1) The derivation is long, and depends on a mass of detail. (2) The analytic function f, fitted to the numerical results of the real-space cutoff, is complicated and nontransparent. (3) f is overparametrized. (4) The parameters are not seamlessly joined [15], leading to spurious wiggles in the exchange-correlation potential dE XC dn s r for small [16] and large [16,17] dimension-less density gradients, which can bedevil the construction of GGA-based electron-ion pseudopotentials [18-20]. (5) Although the numerical GGA correlation energy functional behaves properly [13] under Levy's uniform scaling to the high-density limit [21], its analytic parametrization (PW91) does not [22]. (6) Because PW91 reduces to the second-order gradient expansion for density variations that are either slowly varying or small, it descibes the linear response of the density of a uniform electron gas less satisfactorily than does LSD [20,23]. This last problem illustrates a fact which is often overlooked: The semilocal form of Eq. (2) is too restrictive to reproduce all the known behaviors of the exact functional [13]. In contrast to the construction of the PW91 functional, which was designed to satisfy as many exact conditions as possible, the GGA presented here satisfies only those which are energetically significant. For example , in the pseudopotential theory of simple metals, the linear-response limit is physically important. On the other hand, recovery of the exact second-order gradient expansion in the slowly varying limit makes little difference to the energies of real systems. We solve the 6 problems above with a simple new derivation of a simple new GGA functional in which all parameters [other than those in e unif XC n " , n # ] are fundamental constants. Although the derivation depends only on the most general features of the real-space construction [13] behind PW91, the resulting functional is close to numerical GGA.

Because of this property, the application of the nonlocal part of the pseudopotential to a wave function can be done efficiently on a grid in real space. Real space integration is much faster for large systems than ordinary multiplication in Fourier space, since it shows only quadratic scaling with respect to the size of the system.

   abstract = {The method of dispersion correction as an add-on to standard Kohn-Sham density functional theory (DFT-D) has been refined regarding higher accuracy, broader range of applicability, and less empiricism. The main new ingredients are atom-pairwise specific dispersion coefficients and cutoff radii that are both computed from first principles. The coefficients for new eighth-order dispersion terms are computed using established recursion relations. System (geometry) dependent information is used for the first time in a DFT-D type approach by employing the new concept of fractional coordination numbers (CN). They are used to interpolate between dispersion coefficients of atoms in different chemical environments. The method only requires adjustment of two global parameters for each density functional, is asymptotically exact for a gas of weakly interacting neutral atoms, and easily allows the computation of atomic forces. Three-body nonadditivity terms are considered. The method has been assessed on standard benchmark sets for inter- and intramolecular noncovalent interactions with a particular emphasis on a consistent description of light and heavy element systems. The mean absolute deviations for the S22 benchmark set of noncovalent interactions for 11 standard density functionals decrease by 15\%-40\% compared to the previous (already accurate) DFT-D version. Spectacular improvements are found for a tripeptide-folding model and all tested metallic systems. The rectification of the long-range behavior and the use of more accurate C6 coefficients also lead to a much better description of large (infinite) systems as shown for graphene sheets and the adsorption of benzene on an Ag(111) surface. For graphene it is found that the inclusion of three-body terms substantially (by about 10\%) weakens the interlayer binding. We propose the revised DFT-D method as a general tool for the computation of the dispersion energy in molecules and solids of any kind with DFT and related (low-cost) electronic structure methods for large systems. © 2010 American Institute of Physics.},

   abstract = {The metal-organic framework (MOF), NU-1000, and its metalated counterparts have found proof-of-concept application in heterogeneous catalysis and hydrogen storage among others. A vapor-phase technique, akin to atomic layer deposition (ALD), is used to selectively deposit divalent Cu ions on oxo, hydroxo-bridged hexa-zirconium(IV) nodes capped with terminal -OH and -OH2 ligands. The subsequent reaction with steam yields node-anchored, CuII-oxo, hydroxo clusters. We find that cluster installation via AIM (ALD in MOFs) is accompanied by an expansion of the MOF mesopore (channel) diameter. We investigated the behavior of the cluster-modified material, termed Cu-AIM-NU-1000, to heat treatment up to 325 °C at atmospheric pressure with a low flow of H2 into the reaction cell. The response under these conditions revealed two important results: (1) Above 200 °C, the initially installed few-metal-ion clusters reduce to neutral Cu atoms. The neutral atoms migrate from the nodes and aggregate into Cu nanoparticles. While the size of particles formed in the MOF interior is constrained by the width of mesopores (∼3 nm), the size of those formed on the exterior surface of the MOF can grow as large as ∼8 nm. (2) Reduction and release of Cu atoms from the MOFs nodes is accompanied by the dynamic structural transformation of NU-1000 as it reverts back to its original dimension following the release. These results show that while the MOF framework itself remains intact at 325 °C in an H2 atmosphere, the small, AIM-installed CuII-oxo, hydroxo clusters are stable with respect to reduction and conversion to metallic nanoparticles only up to ∼200 °C.},

Time-resolved operando spectroscopy measurements indicate that the activity of the catalyst is associated with atomically dispersed, positively charged ionic Cu species.

Limited success has been achieved in incorporating biologically relevant ligands for the formation of such active site in a synthetic system. Here, we report the design and synthesis of metal-organic framework (MOF) catalysts inspired by pMMO for selective methane oxidation to methanol. By judicious selection of a framework with appropriate topology and chemical functionality, MOF-808 was used to postsynthetically install ligands bearing imidazole units for subsequent metalation with Cu(I) in the presence of dioxygen. The catalysts show high selectivity for methane oxidation to methanol under isothermal conditions at 150 °C. Combined spectroscopies and density functional theory calculations suggest bis(μ-oxo) dicopper species as probable active site of the catalysts.},

Experimental evidence allows for identification of spectroscopic similarities between Al-NU-1000 and γ-Al2O3. Density functional theory modeling provides structures and simulated spectra, the relevance of which can be assessed via comparison to experimental IR and EXAFS data.

Additionally, their crystalline nature affords the opportunity for molecular level characterization of both the support and the catalytically active site, facilitating mechanistic investigations of the catalytic process. We describe herein the installation of Co(II) ions to the Zr6 nodes of the mesoporous MOF, NU-1000, via two distinct routes, namely, solvothermal deposition in a MOF (SIM) and atomic layer deposition in a MOF (AIM), denoted as Co-SIM+NU-1000 and Co-AIM+NU-1000, respectively. The location of the deposited Co species in the two materials is determined via difference envelope density (DED) analysis. Upon activation in a flow of O2 at 230 °C, both materials catalyze the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane to propene under mild conditions. Catalytic activity as well as propene selectivity of these two catalysts, however, is different under the same experimental conditions due to differences in the Co species generated in these two materials upon activation as observed by in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy. A potential reaction mechanism for the propane ODH process catalyzed by Co-SIM+NU-1000 is proposed, yielding a low activation energy barrier which is in accord with the observed catalytic activity at low temperature.},

Specifically, a combination of density functional theory (DFT), microkinetic modeling, and high throughput reactor experiments is used to interrogate the active sites and mechanisms for Mn@NU-1000, Fe@NU-1000, Co@NU-1000, Ni@NU-1000, Cu@NU-1000, and Zn@NU-1000 catalysts, where NU-1000 is a metal-organic framework (MOF) capable of supporting metal cation catalysts. The combination of experiments and simulations suggests that the reaction mechanism is influenced by the electron configuration and spin state of the metal cations as well as the amount of hydrogen that is adsorbed. Specifically, Ni@NU-1000, Cu@NU-1000, and Zn@NU-1000, which have more electrons in their d shells and operate in lower spin states, utilize a metal hydride active site and follow a mechanism where the metal cation binds with one or more species at all steps, whereas Mn@NU-1000, Fe@NU-1000, and Co@NU-1000, which have fewer electrons in their d shells and operate in higher spin states, utilize a bare metal cation active site and follow a mechanism where the number of species that bind to the metal cation is minimized. Instead of binding with the metal cation, catalytic species bind with oxo ligands from the NU-1000 support, as this enables more facile H2adsorption. The results reveal opportunities for tuning activity and selectivity for hydrogenation on metal cation catalysts by tuning the properties that influence hydrogen content and spin, including the metal cations themselves, the ligands, the binding environments and supports, and/or the gas phase partial pressures.},

Ni-AIM is demonstrated to be an efficient gas-phase hydrogenation catalyst upon activation. The structure of the active sites in Ni-AIM is proposed, revealing its single-site nature.

A quantum chemical characterization of the catalyst and the catalytic process complements the experimental results. With validation of computational modeling protocols, we further targeted ethylene oligomerization catalysis by Ni-AIM guided by theoretical prediction.

Understanding the structure of newly deposited species and how they are tethered within the MOF is critical to understanding how these components couple to govern the active material properties. By combining local and long-range structure probes, including X-ray absorption spectroscopy, pair distribution function analysis, and difference envelope density analysis, with electron microscopy imaging and computational modeling, we resolve the precise atomic structure of metal-oxo species deposited in the MOF NU-1000 through ALD. These analyses demonstrate that deposition of NiO x H y clusters occurs selectively within the smallest pores of NU-1000, between the zirconia nodes, serving to connect these nodes along the c-direction to yield heterobimetallic metal-oxo nanowires. This bridging motif perturbs the NU-1000 framework structure, drawing the zirconia nodes closer together, and also underlies the sintering resistance of these clusters during the hydrogenation of light olefins.},

Despite the well-known leaching problem of supported molybdenum catalysts (i.e., loss of Mo species thus causes deactivation), Mo-SIM demonstrated no loss in the metal loading before and after catalysis, and no molybdenum was detected in the reaction mixture.

Using degree of rate control analysis, it was determined that the rate controlling steps are either ethene insertion (C–C bond forming) or β-hydride elimination (C–H bond breaking), depending on the metal.

   abstract = {The Shell Higher Olefins Process (SHOP) is probably the most remarkable industrial chemical process to have been developed in the past decade. It involves four reactions-oligomerization, linear hydroformylation, double bond isomerization, and metathesis-reactions which have scarcely found their way into college chemistry textbooks. At the same time it has satisfied an important industrial need. The new process involves the manipulation of older reactions with a particular application in mind; it is this mission-related chemistry that typifies creative thinking in industry. The main aim of the process is the manufacture of primary C, i-Cx5 fatty alcohols. These are valuable for the manufacture of alcohol sulfate detergents. Such detergents have been known for a long time but were used only to a limited extent in heavy duty detergents because of their cost. They are desired now because they biodegrade more quickly than the conventional linear alkylbenzene sulfonates and are less toxic to fish. The traditional route to straight-chain fatty alcohols involves the alcoholysis of a vegetable oil-a fatty acid trigly-ceride-to its methyl ester, which is then converted to a primary alcohol by hydrogenolysis. The chemical industry does not like agricultural feedstocks because supplies are unreliable and fluctuate with factors such as the weather and attack by pests. As the detergent industry grew, various routes to straight-chain intermedi-ates were devised based on petrochemical feedstocks. All these suffered from the same problem; they led to mixtures of products that spanned a range of molecular weights. Once the compounds in the detergent range had been extracted, byproducts of lower and higher chain length remained, of which few found a ready market. The SHOP process solves this problem by producing only alcohols of the chain length preferred for surfactants. A simplified flowsheet for the SHOP process is shown in the figure. We shall describe the individual reactions before showing how they integrate into the overall process. The starting material is ethylene (ethene), which is readily available from the steam cracking of hydrocarbons, a process that is the keystone of the petrochemical industry and that is carried out in huge plants each producing at least one billion pounds per year of ethylene. Oligomerization Ethylene may be polymerized to polyethylene by Ziegler-Natta polymerization, which involves the use of a titanium tetrachloride/aluminum trialkyl catalyst. A related process gives ethylene oligomers. Thus stoichiometric amounts of aluminum triethyl react with ethylene to give trialkylalu-minum compounds. Air oxidation gives aluminum alkox-ides, which may be hydrolyzed to straight-chain fatty alcohols or pyrolyzed to olefins:},

In contrast, although the concept has long existed, single-atom heterogeneous catalysts (SACs) have only recently gained prominence. Host materials have similar functions to ligands in homogeneous catalysts, determining the stability, local environment, and electronic properties of isolated atoms and thus providing a platform for tailoring heterogeneous catalysts for targeted applications. Within just a decade, we have witnessed many examples of SACs both disrupting diverse fields of heterogeneous catalysis with their distinctive reactivity and substantially enriching our understanding of molecular processes on surfaces. To date, the term SAC mostly refers to late transition metal-based systems, but numerous examples exist in which isolated atoms of other elements play key catalytic roles. This review provides a compositional encyclopedia of SACs, celebrating the 10th anniversary of the introduction of this term. By defining single-atom catalysis in the broadest sense, we explore the full elemental diversity, joining different areas across the whole periodic table, and discussing historical milestones and recent developments. In particular, we examine the coordination structures and associated properties accessed through distinct single-atom-host combinations and relate them to their main applications in thermo-, electro-, and photocatalysis, revealing trends in element-specific evolution, host design, and uses. Finally, we highlight frontiers in the field, including multimetallic SACs, atom proximity control, and possible applications for multistep and cascade reactions, identifying challenges, and propose directions for future development in this flourishing field.},

   abstract = {Supported metal nanostructures are the most widely used type of heterogeneous catalyst in industrial processes. The size of metal particles is a key factor in determining the performance of such catalysts. In particular, because low-coordinated metal atoms often function as the catalytically active sites, the specific activity per metal atom usually increases with decreasing size of the metal particles. However, the surface free energy of metals increases significantly with decreasing particle size, promoting aggregation of small clusters. Using an appropriate support material that strongly interacts with the metal species prevents this aggregation, creating stable, finely dispersed metal clusters with a high catalytic activity, an approach industry has used for a long time. Nevertheless, practical supported metal catalysts are inhomogeneous and usually consist of a mixture of sizes from nanoparticles to subnanometer clusters. Such heterogeneity not only reduces the metal atom efficiency but also frequently leads to undesired side reactions. It also makes it extremely difficult, if not impossible, to uniquely identify and control the active sites of interest.The ultimate small-size limit for metal particles is the single-atom catalyst (SAC), which contains isolated metal atoms singly dispersed on supports. SACs maximize the efficiency of metal atom use, which is particularly important for supported noble metal catalysts. Moreover, with well-defined and uniform single-atom dispersion, SACs offer great potential for achieving high activity and selectivity.In this Account, we highlight recent advances in preparation, characterization, and catalytic performance of SACs, with a focus on single atoms anchored to metal oxides, metal surfaces, and graphene. We discuss experimental and theoretical studies for a variety of reactions, including oxidation, water gas shift, and hydrogenation. We describe advances in understanding the spatial arrangements and electronic properties of single atoms, as well as their interactions with the support. Single metal atoms on support surfaces provide a unique opportunity to tune active sites and optimize the activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts, offering the potential for applications in a variety of industrial chemical reactions. © 2013 American Chemical Society.},

   abstract = {The kinetics of Pt-catalyzed NO oxidation on both Pt(111) and Pt(321) are quantified from first-principles using a coverage-aware "reaction site" kinetic model. Density functional theory (DFT)-parametrized cluster expansions are used to predict oxygen coverages and availability of O2 dissociation sites as a function of reaction conditions. DFT calculations are used to parametrize a Bronsted-Evans-Polanyi relationship for O2 dissociation on Pt(321). Ensemble averaging over available sites and their corresponding rates yields total reaction rates. Predicted apparent activation energies and rate orders are consistent with the experimental observations on single crystal catalysts and are most strongly determined by the coverage dependence of O adsorption rather than the statistical availability of O2 dissociation sites. Rates and rate derivatives are similar on the two surfaces over the range of experimental observation and are predicted to differ more significantly outside this range. (Graph Presented).},

   abstract = {The adsorption, dissociation, and desorption of O 2 on Cu(111), Cu(110), and Cu(100) surfaces at different coverages were studied at the molecular level. The dissociation energies of O 2 molecules increase with the increase in coverage of adsorbed O 2 . The saturated coverage of O atoms from dissociation of O 2 molecules on Cu(111), Cu(110), and Cu(100) surfaces are 0.25, 0.75, and 0.375 ML, respectively. Based on the computed Gibbs free energies, the relationships between O atoms/O 2 molecules and temperature, as well as O 2 partial pressure, on these surfaces are established. Cu(111), Cu(110), and Cu(100) surfaces are covered by O atoms under ultra-high vacuum at 298 K, with O atom coverage of 0.25, 0.625, and 0.375 ML, respectively. Phase diagrams provide useful information on phase transition from Cu to Cu 2 O in terms of temperature and O 2 partial pressure. Results of this study may provide guidance in investigating the interaction between O 2 and transition metals.},

   abstract = {Using a kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) approach with parameters derived from first-principles calculations, we modeled the steady-state of CO oxidation on Pd(111), a prototypical catalytic system with various practical applications, including the treatment of automotive gas exhausts. Focusing on the metallic phase of the catalyst, we studied how the rate of CO oxidation depends on temperature and pressure, at fixed gas phase composition. Comparing the results of our simulations with experimental data, we found that all the qualitative features of this catalytic system are correctly reproduced by our model. We show that, when raising the temperature, the system transitions from a CO-poisoned regime with high apparent activation energy to a regime where the rate is almost independent of the temperature. The almost zero apparent activation energy at high temperature stems from approximately equal and opposite values of the O2adsorption energy and dissociation barrier, as revealed by a simple microkinetic analysis. In the CO-poisoned regime, the precursor-mediated dissociative adsorption of oxygen plays a crucial role: we find that small changes (within DFT error) in the parameters controlling this elementary step have large effects on the kinetics of CO oxidation at low temperature.},

   abstract = {Composite materials composed of nanoparticles trapped within metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) combine the broad functionality of nanotechnology with the structural regularity of crystalline scaffolds. Still, leveraging the tunability of MOF pore sizes to control nanoparticle diameter and spatial arrangement in these composites remains a great challenge. Here we present two Zr-based MOFs, NU-901 and NU-907, with distinct pore diameters that serve as templates for the controlled growth of Cu nanoparticles (CuNPs) of different sizes (∼1.5 nm and ∼0.9 nm, respectively). In situ synchrotron X-ray scattering and diffraction experiments, along with pair distribution function and difference envelope density analyses, provide crucial insight into the size and location of these CuNPs in the pores of each MOF. These composites (denoted as CuNPs@NU-901 and CuNPs@NU-907) are shown to be competent catalysts for the selective hydrogenation of acetylene to ethylene, with a clear structure–property relationship indicating that},

   abstract = {We explore the dynamic structure and reactivity of Cu species supported on NU-1000. By combining pair distribution function (PDF) analysis and difference envelope density (DED) analysis of in situ synchrotron-based X-ray scattering data, we simultaneously probe the local structure of supported Cu-species, their distribution within NU-1000 and distortions of the NU-1000 lattice under conditions relevant to catalysis and catalyst activation. These analyses show that atomic layer deposition (ALD) of Cu in NU-1000 (Cu-AIM) leads to the formation of Cu-oxo clusters within the small pores that connect the triangular and hexagonal channels. Exposure of Cu-AIM to a reducing atmosphere at 200 °C produces metallic Cu0 of two distinct particle sizes: ∼4 nm nanoparticles and small sub-nanometer clusters. The size of these nanoparticles appears to be constrained by NU-1000 pore dimensions, with evidence of the sub-nanometer clusters being bound within the triangular channels flanked by pyrene rings. This supported Cu0-NU-1000 system is catalytically active for gas-phase ethylene hydrogenation. Exposure of the catalyst to oxidative atmosphere re-oxidises the Cu species to a Cu2O cuprite phase. The dynamic restructuring of the system in different chemical environments underscores the importance of probing these systems in situ.},
