        \caption{Diagram showing the assumed equilibria necessary to transform with \ce{H}, \ce{OH}, \ce{Ni} for the \textit{ab initio} thermodynamic analysis method. The assume assumed equilibria capture the operating conditions influences on the stability of the \ce{Ni} ion cluster.}

    \end{figure}

    Figure~\ref{fig:SI-FPT-process-diagram} shows a schematic for \textit{ab initio} thermodynamic analysis, which is used to evaluate the stability of a \ce{Ni4}-cluster supported on NU-1000. We assume the \ce{Ni} ion cluster is in equilibrium with three different reservoirs, which allows for transformations with respect to \ce{H}, \ce{O}, and \ce{Ni}. Equilibrium with the bulk \ce{Ni} reservoir is turned off by assuming $\Delta N_{\ce{Ni}} = 0$, implying that the number of \ce{Ni} ions is fixed at four. We derive expressions relating the chemical potentials for each transformed species to their respective bulk reservoirs.

%% Free Energy Expression
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\newpage
\subsection{Deriving the free energy expressions}
We transform the free energy from a fixed number of atoms to a fixed chemical potential to account for the compositional variation of different activated clusters (Eq.~\ref{eq:transformation1}):
\begin{equation}
    F^{(0)}(V,T,N_{\text{H}},N_{\text{O}},N_{\text{Ni}}) \rightarrow 
    F^{(2)}(V,T,\mu_{\text{H}}, \mu_{\text{O}}, N_{\text{Ni}})    \rightarrow F^{(3)}(V,T,\mu_{\text{H}},\mu_{\text{O}},\mu_{\text{Ni}})
    \label{eq:transformation1}
\end{equation}
where $F$ is the Helmholtz free energy, $V$ is volume, $T$ is temperature, $\mu$ is chemical potential, and $N$ is the number of \ce{O}, \ce{H}, and \ce{Ni} atoms. The (2) superscript on $F^{(2)}$ indicates the second Legendre transform of $F^{(0)}$,\cite{Alberty1997} i.e., of $N_{\ce{H}}$ and $N_{\ce{O}}$ to $\mu_{\ce{H}}$ and $\mu_{\ce{O}}$, respectively. Additionally, the (3) superscript on $F^{(3)}$ indicates the Legendre transform of $F^{(2)}$ from $N_{\ce{Ni}}$ to $\mu_{\ce{Ni}}$. We write the transformed free energy expression for $F^{(2)}$ as Eq.~\ref{eq:free-energy-ind} and $F^{(3)}$ as Eq.~\ref{eq:free-energy-ind-Ni}. 
\begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
        F^{(2)}(V,T,\mu_{\text{H}},\mu_{\text{O}},N_{\text{Ni}}) =  F^{(0)}(V,T,N_{\text{H}},N_{\text{O}},N_{\text{Ni}}) - (\mu_{\text{H}})(N_{\text{H}}) - (\mu_{\text{O}})(N_{\text{O}})  \\ 
    \end{split}
    \label{eq:free-energy-ind}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
        F^{(3)}(V,T,\mu_{\text{H}},\mu_{\text{O}},\mu_{\text{Ni}}) = F^{(2)}(V,T,\mu_{\text{H}},\mu_{\text{O}},N_{\text{Ni}}) - (\mu_{\text{Ni}})(N_{\text{Ni}}) \\ 
    \end{split}
    \label{eq:free-energy-ind-Ni}
\end{equation}


%The difference in free energy between structures is then calculated by taking the difference between two structures, denoted modified and reference. 

%The free energy expressions in Eq.~\ref{eq:free-energy-ind} and $F^{(3)}$ as Eq.~\ref{eq:free-energy-ind-Ni} 

%We write the transformed free energy expression for $F^{(3)}$ as Eq.~\ref{eq:free-energy-trans-Ni}:

%where \hl{LABEL ALL OF THE DIFFERENT VARIABLES HERE}

The final transformed free energy expression ($\Delta F^{(2)}$) is computed relative to the reference structure (\hl{as shown in the main text in} Figure~\ref{fig:Ni-MOF-structures}a). We write the transformed free energy expression for $\Delta F^{(2)}$ as Eq.~\ref{eq:free-energy-trans}: 
\begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
        \Delta F^{(2)}(V,T,\mu_{\text{H}},\mu_{\text{O}},N_{\text{Ni}})  
        & = \Delta F^{(0)}(V,T,N_{\text{H}},N_{\text{O}},N_{\text{Ni}}) - (\mu_{\text{H}})(\Delta N_{\text{H}}) 
        - (\mu_{\text{O}})(\Delta N_{\text{O}})  \\ 
    \end{split}
    \label{eq:free-energy-trans}
\end{equation}
where $\Delta N_{\text{H}}$ and $\Delta N_{\text{O}}$ are computed by taking the difference in the number of \ce{O} and \ce{H} atoms of the cluster relative to the reference structure. A similar expression is constructed for $F^{(3)}$ (Eq.~\ref{eq:free-energy-trans-Ni}):
\begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
        \Delta F^{(3)}(V,T,\mu_{\text{H}},\mu_{\text{O}},\mu_{\text{Ni}})  
        = \Delta F^{(2)}(V,T,\mu_{\text{H}},\mu_{\text{O}},N_{\text{Ni}}) - (\mu_{\text{Ni}})(\Delta N_{\text{Ni}}) \\ 
    \end{split}
    \label{eq:free-energy-trans-Ni}
\end{equation}
where $\Delta N_{\text{Ni}}$ is also computed by taking the difference in the number of \ce{Ni} atoms of the cluster relative to the reference structure.

%% Equilibrium Expressions
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\newpage
\subsection{Equilibrium expressions for chemical potential terms}
For \ce{H}, the assumed equilibrium is with a reservoir of \ce{H2} gas:
\begin{equation}
    \frac{1}{2} H_{2}(g) \ce{<=>} H
\end{equation}
where the chemical potential terms are related by: 
\begin{equation}
    \frac{1}{2} \mu_{\ce{H2}}^{g}(T,P) = \mu_{\ce{H}}
\end{equation}  
\hl{The $\mu_{\ce{H2}}^{g}(T,P)$ is computed by  correcting the electronic energy (referenced at $T$=0 K) of an isolated molecule with the gas-phase Gibbs free energy values at a specific temperature and pressure} (shown in Eq.~S\ref{H2-to-reaction-conditions}). 
\begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
         \mu_{\ce{H2}}^{g}(T,P) &= E_{\ce{H2}}^{DFT} + E_{\ce{H2}}^{ZPE}+ \Delta \mu_{\ce{H2}}(T,P)  \\
    \end{split}
    \label{H2-to-reaction-conditions}
\end{equation}
In our analysis, $\mu_{\ce{H2}}(T,P)$ is an independent variable; we varied $\mu_{\ce{H2}}(T,P)$ to generate the \hl{phase diagrams shown in} Figure~\ref{fig:Ni-structure-diagram}. Furthermore, the $\mu_{\ce{H2}}^{g}(T,P)$ can be related to the temperature and pressure conditions of the system by relating the term to the free energy of the gas phase species using Eq.~S\ref{mu_2_G}:
\begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
         \Delta \mu_{\ce{H2}}(T,P) &= \Delta G_{H_{2}}(T,P)\\
         \Delta \mu_{\ce{H2}}(T,P) &= \Big[ \Delta G_{\ce{H2}}(T,P^{o})  + RT \ln{ \frac{P_{\ce{H2}}}{P_{\ce{H2}}^{o}}} \Big]  \\ 
    \end{split}
    \label{mu_2_G}
\end{equation}
where $\Delta G_{\ce{H2}}(T,P^{o})$ is the free energy referenced to 0 K, $R$ is gas constant, $T$ is the temperature, $P_{\ce{H2}}$ is the partial pressure of \ce{H2} gas and $P_{\ce{H2}}^{o}$ is the standard pressure (1 bar).  

\hl{With all calculations being performed at 0 K, the $G_{H_{2}}(T,P)$ was referenced to 0 K when evaluating the free energy from pMuTT. The electronic energy ($E_{H_{2}}^{DFT}$) were calculated in CP2K using the same computational parameters as described in the methodology section of the manuscript.}

\subsection{Deriving gas phase free energies values from empirical data}
The NASA Polynomials\hl{REF-XXX} are defined for a specific temperature range \hl{(i.e., from XXX to XXX)}. To correct the electronic energies from DFT, the gas phase species must be referenced to approximately 0 K. The standard reference state for the NASA Polynomials is 298 K; therefore, the empirical methods are approximated to 0 K using Eq.~S\ref{eq:pmutt-expression} by referencing the values at 10 K, following prior work.\hl{REF-Getman-FPT-Paper}
\begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
        \Delta G(T, P^{o}) &= [G(T,P^{o}) - G(T=298 K, P^{o})] - [G(T=10 K, P^{o}) - G(T=298 K, P^{o})] \\
        \Delta G(T, P^{o}) &= [G(T,P^{o})] - [G(T=10 K, P^{o})] 
    \end{split}
    \label{eq:pmutt-expression}
\end{equation} 
where $\Delta G(T, P^{o})$ is the free energy referenced at $T = 10$~K, and $G(T,P^{o})$ is the free energy referenced at $T = 298$~K. Figures~\ref{fig:h2-pmutt-expression} and \ref{fig:h2o-pmutt-expression} show the extrapolation of the NASA Polynomial referenced to 0~K.

\subsection{Identifying spin contamination in DFT calculations}
The library was optimized at different \ce{Ni} spin states; the considered spin states for \ce{Ni} ions were singlet (no unpaired electrons) and triplet (two unpaired electrons). With the cluster initially containing four \ce{Ni} ions, the intermediate combinations were calculated (one singlet and three triplet, two singlet and two triplet, etc.). Structures that exhibited spin contamination were removed from the analysis. Comparisons between the ideal and single determinant $S^{**}2$ values were inspected. If the single determinant value deviated by more than 10\% of the ideal determinant the structure was removed from analysis.

        c) Three singlet, one triplet            & -4778.88313 & 2.000  & 3.978  & Yes \\
        d) Two singlet, two triplet              & -4778.88042 & 6.000  & 6.457  & Yes \\
        e) One singlet, three triplet            & -4778.88209 & 12.000 & 12.014 & No \\
        f) Four triplet                          & -4778.84120 & 20.000 & 20.013 & No \\

\end{table}    
\end{center}
From Table \ref{tbl:spin_contamination}, the lowest energy structure is c) three singlet, one triplet \ce{Ni} ions; however, the structure is removed from the analysis because the ideal $S^{**}2$ and single $S^{**}2$ deviate. Therefore, the lowest energy structure for this particular configuration is the e) one singlet, three triplet \ce{Ni} ions.

\subsection{Sample Input File for \ce{Ni4} Clusters - Frequency}
Below is a sample CP2K input file for frequency calculations. The &MOTION section is used to freeze all framework and node atoms in the MOF, thereby calculating only the vibrational modes of the cluster atoms. The xyz file is formatted so that the frozen atoms are the first 548 atoms of the file.

\subsection{Frequency Calculations}
We fix the organic linker and inorganic nodes, thereby only calculating only the \ce{Ni} cluster vibrational contributions to the free energy ($F^\text{vib}$). We ensure that the same atoms are fixed across all frequency calculations in order to correctly compare ($F^\text{vib}$). When constructing the vibrational partition function, all frequencies less than 50 cm\textsuperscript{-1} are replaced with 50 cm\textsuperscript{-1} to correct for the breakdown in the harmonic oscillator approximation for low frequency vibrational modes.\cite{Ribeiro2011} The partitions functions are computed in the pMuTT\cite{LYM2019106864} Python package to compute $E^\text{ZP}$ and $F^\text{vib}$ for all structures. A sample input file for the CP2K frequency calculations is provided in the Supporting Information.
