    \end{figure}

    Figure~\ref{fig:SI-FPT-process-diagram} shows a schematic for \textit{ab initio} thermodynamic analysis,\cite{Reuter2003, Reuter2004, Grundner2015, Paolucci2016, Li2016, Getman2008, Mandal2020, Zuo2016, Tang2019} which is used to evaluate the stability of a \ce{Ni4}-cluster supported on NU-1000. We assume the \ce{Ni} ion cluster is in equilibrium with three different reservoirs, which allows for transformations with respect to \ce{H}, \ce{O}, and \ce{Ni}. Equilibrium with the bulk \ce{Ni} reservoir is turned off by assuming $\Delta N_{\ce{Ni}} = 0$, implying that the number of \ce{Ni} ions is fixed at four. We derive expressions relating the chemical potentials for each transformed species to their respective bulk reservoirs.

%% Free Energy Expression
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\newpage
\subsection{Deriving the free energy expressions}
We transform the free energy from a fixed number of atoms to a fixed chemical potential to account for the compositional variation of different activated clusters (Eq.~\ref{eq:transformation1}) using Legendre transforms:\cite{Alberty1997}
\begin{equation}
    F^{(0)}(V,T,N_{\text{H}},N_{\text{O}},N_{\text{Ni}}) \rightarrow 
    F^{(2)}(V,T,\mu_{\text{H}}, \mu_{\text{O}}, N_{\text{Ni}})    \rightarrow F^{(3)}(V,T,\mu_{\text{H}},\mu_{\text{O}},\mu_{\text{Ni}})
    \label{eq:transformation1}
\end{equation}
where $F$ is the Helmholtz free energy, $V$ is volume, $T$ is temperature, $\mu$ is chemical potential, and $N$ is the number of \ce{O}, \ce{H}, and \ce{Ni} atoms. The (2) superscript on $F^{(2)}$ indicates the second Legendre transform of $F^{(0)}$ (i.e., of $N_{\ce{H}}$ and $N_{\ce{O}}$ to $\mu_{\ce{H}}$ and $\mu_{\ce{O}}$, respectively). Additionally, the (3) superscript on $F^{(3)}$ indicates the Legendre transform of $F^{(2)}$ from $N_{\ce{Ni}}$ to $\mu_{\ce{Ni}}$. We write the transformed free energy expression for $F^{(2)}$ as Eq.~\ref{eq:free-energy-ind} and $F^{(3)}$ as Eq.~\ref{eq:free-energy-ind-Ni}. 
\begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
        F^{(2)}(V,T,\mu_{\text{H}},\mu_{\text{O}},N_{\text{Ni}}) =  F^{(0)}(V,T,N_{\text{H}},N_{\text{O}},N_{\text{Ni}}) - (\mu_{\text{H}})(N_{\text{H}}) - (\mu_{\text{O}})(N_{\text{O}})  \\ 
    \end{split}
    \label{eq:free-energy-ind}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
        F^{(3)}(V,T,\mu_{\text{H}},\mu_{\text{O}},\mu_{\text{Ni}}) = F^{(2)}(V,T,\mu_{\text{H}},\mu_{\text{O}},N_{\text{Ni}}) - (\mu_{\text{Ni}})(N_{\text{Ni}}) \\ 
    \end{split}
    \label{eq:free-energy-ind-Ni}
\end{equation}


%The difference in free energy between structures is then calculated by taking the difference between two structures, denoted modified and reference. 

%The free energy expressions in Eq.~\ref{eq:free-energy-ind} and $F^{(3)}$ as Eq.~\ref{eq:free-energy-ind-Ni} 

%We write the transformed free energy expression for $F^{(3)}$ as Eq.~\ref{eq:free-energy-trans-Ni}:

%where \hl{LABEL ALL OF THE DIFFERENT VARIABLES HERE}

The final transformed free energy expression ($\Delta F^{(2)}$) is computed relative to the reference structure, \ce{Ni4(OH)6.4H2O} (green), as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:SI-dPDF-green}. We write the transformed free energy expression for $\Delta F^{(2)}$ as Eq.~\ref{eq:free-energy-trans}: 
\begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
        \Delta F^{(2)}(V,T,\mu_{\text{H}},\mu_{\text{O}},N_{\text{Ni}})  
        & = \Delta F^{(0)}(V,T,N_{\text{H}},N_{\text{O}},N_{\text{Ni}}) - (\mu_{\text{H}})(\Delta N_{\text{H}}) 
        - (\mu_{\text{O}})(\Delta N_{\text{O}})  \\ 
    \end{split}
    \label{eq:free-energy-trans}
\end{equation}
where $\Delta N_{\text{H}}$ and $\Delta N_{\text{O}}$ are computed by taking the difference in the number of \ce{O} and \ce{H} atoms of the cluster relative to the reference structure. A similar expression is constructed for $F^{(3)}$ (Eq.~\ref{eq:free-energy-trans-Ni}) when looking at variable \ce{Ni} ion content:
\begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
        \Delta F^{(3)}(V,T,\mu_{\text{H}},\mu_{\text{O}},\mu_{\text{Ni}})  
        = \Delta F^{(2)}(V,T,\mu_{\text{H}},\mu_{\text{O}},N_{\text{Ni}}) - (\mu_{\text{Ni}})(\Delta N_{\text{Ni}}) \\ 
    \end{split}
    \label{eq:free-energy-trans-Ni}
\end{equation}
where $\Delta N_{\text{Ni}}$ is also computed by taking the difference in the number of \ce{Ni} atoms of the cluster relative to the reference structure.

%% Equilibrium Expressions
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\newpage
\subsection{Equilibrium expressions for chemical potential terms}
Eq.~\ref{eq:free-energy-trans} computes the free energy as a function of both \ce{H} and \ce{O} chemical potentials ($\mu_{\text{H}}$ and $\mu_{\text{O}}$). During \textit{ab initio} thermodynamic analysis, these chemical potentials are varied to study their influence on the free energy. As described in Fig.~\ref{fig:SI-FPT-process-diagram}, the cluster is assumed to be in equilibrium with \ce{H2} and \ce{H2O} reservoirs; we relate reservoir chemical potentials to the chemical potentials of the cluster atoms, \ce{H} and \ce{O} (from Eq.~\ref{eq:free-energy-trans}). 

For \ce{H} on the \ce{Ni4}-cluster, the assumed equilibrium is with a reservoir of \ce{H2} gas:
\begin{equation}
    \ce{H} \ce{<=>} \frac{1}{2} \ce{H2}(g)  
\end{equation}
with the chemical potential terms related according to:
\begin{equation}
    \mu_{\ce{H}} = \frac{1}{2} \mu_{\ce{H2}}^{g}(T,P)
\end{equation}  
$\mu_{\ce{H2}}^{g}(T,P)$ is the gas phase reservoir chemical potential term, and is computed by  correcting the electronic energy (referenced at $T$=0 K) of an isolated molecule with the gas-phase free energy values at a specific temperature and pressure.\cite{Li2016} Eq.~\ref{H2-to-reaction-conditions} shows the correction. 
\begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
         \mu_{\ce{H2}}^{g}(T,P) &= E_{\ce{H2}}^{DFT} + E_{\ce{H2}}^{ZPE}+ \Delta \mu_{\ce{H2}}(T,P)  \\
    \end{split}
    \label{H2-to-reaction-conditions}
\end{equation}
In our analysis, $\Delta \mu_{\ce{H2}}(T,P)$ is an independent variable. By varying $\Delta \mu_{\ce{H2}}(T,P)$, we compute the free energy at different conditions, which generates the all phase diagrams and heat maps.

For \ce{O} on the \ce{Ni4}-cluster, the assumed equilibrium is with a reservoir of both \ce{H2O} and \ce{H2} gas:
\begin{equation}
    \ce{H2} + \ce{O} \ce{<=>} \ce{H2O}
\end{equation}
with the chemical potential terms related according to:
\begin{equation}
    \mu_{\ce{O}} = \mu_{\ce{H2O}}^{g}(T,P) - \mu_{\ce{H2}}^{g}(T,P)
\end{equation}
where $\mu_{\ce{H2O}}^{g}(T,P)$ is the gas phase reservoir chemical potential term. A similar expression to Eq.~\ref{H2-to-reaction-conditions} is constructed to relate the electronic energy (referenced at $T$=0 K) of an isolated molecule with the gas-phase free energy values (Eq.~\ref{H2O-to-reaction-conditions}). 
\begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
         \mu_{\ce{H2O}}^{g}(T,P) &= E_{\ce{H2O}}^{DFT} + E_{\ce{H2O}}^{ZPE} + \Delta \mu_{\ce{H2O}}(T,P)  \\
    \end{split}
    \label{H2O-to-reaction-conditions}
\end{equation}
Again, $\Delta \mu_{\ce{H2O}}(T,P)$ is another independent variable that is tunable in our analysis. Unlike \ce{H2}, the \ce{H2O} chemical potential is not known for these systems. During activation, the cluster is exposed to 3.5\% \ce{H2} in \ce{He} gas at $P$ = 1 bar and $T$ ranging from 50 \degree C to 200 \degree C.\cite{Li2016sintering} We can relate these conditions to an \ce{H2} chemical potential; however, water is not explicitly added to the system during activation or subsequent steps. We therefore vary the \ce{H2O} chemical potential by changing $\Delta \mu_{\ce{H2O}}(T,P)$ during \textit{ab initio} thermodynamic analysis. 




$R$ is gas constant, $T$ is the temperature, $P_{\ce{H2}}$ is the partial pressure of \ce{H2} gas and $P_{\ce{H2}}^{o}$ is the standard pressure (1 bar).  




% Both $\Delta \mu_{\ce{H2}}(T,P)$ and $\Delta \mu_{\ce{H2O}}(T,P)$ are equal to $\Delta G_{\ce{H2}}(T,P)$ and $\Delta G_{\ce{H2O}}(T,P)$, respectively. Therefore, the temperature and pressure conditions of the system are linked to the 

% Both $\Delta G_{\ce{H2}}(T,P)$ and $\Delta G_{\ce{H2O}}(T,P)$ must be referenced at 0 K and vacuum instead of standard state conditions found within the literature.   


% \hl{With all calculations being performed at 0 K, the $G_{H_{2}}(T,P)$ was referenced to 0 K when evaluating the free energy from pMuTT. The electronic energy ($E_{H_{2}}^{DFT}$) were calculated in CP2K using the same computational parameters as described in the methodology section of the manuscript.} 


% \hl{---------------------------------------------------------}


% Furthermore, the $\mu_{\ce{H2}}^{g}(T,P)$ can be related to the temperature and pressure conditions of the system by relating the term to the free energy of the gas phase species using Eq.~\ref{mu_2_G}:
% \begin{equation}
%     \begin{split}
%          \Delta \mu_{\ce{H2}}(T,P) &= \Delta G_{H_{2}}(T,P)\\
%          \Delta \mu_{\ce{H2}}(T,P) &= \Big[ \Delta G_{\ce{H2}}(T,P^{o})  + RT \ln{ \frac{P_{\ce{H2}}}{P_{\ce{H2}}^{o}}} \Big]  \\ 
%     \end{split}
%     \label{mu_2_G}
% \end{equation}
% where $\Delta G_{\ce{H2}}(T,P^{o})$ is the free energy referenced to 0 K, $R$ is gas constant, $T$ is the temperature, $P_{\ce{H2}}$ is the partial pressure of \ce{H2} gas and $P_{\ce{H2}}^{o}$ is the standard pressure (1 bar).  

% \hl{With all calculations being performed at 0 K, the $G_{H_{2}}(T,P)$ was referenced to 0 K when evaluating the free energy from pMuTT. The electronic energy ($E_{H_{2}}^{DFT}$) were calculated in CP2K using the same computational parameters as described in the methodology section of the manuscript.} 

\newpage
\subsection{Deriving gas phase free energies values from empirical data}
Both $\Delta \mu_{\ce{H2}}(T,P)$ and $\Delta \mu_{\ce{H2O}}(T,P)$ written as a function of $T$ and $P$ is shown in Eq.~\ref{chemical_potential_ref}:
\begin{equation}
        \Delta \mu_{i}(T,P) = \Delta \mu_{i}(T,P^{o}) + \Big[ RT \ln{ \frac{P_{i}}{P^{o}}} \Big]
    \label{chemical_potential_ref}
\end{equation}
where $\Delta \mu_{i}(T,P^{o})$ is the chemical potential of species $i$ referenced at $T$ is the temperature and $P^{o}$, and $R$ is gas constant.

The NASA Polynomials\hl{REF-XXX} are defined for a specific temperature range \hl{(i.e., from XXX to XXX)}. To correct the electronic energies from DFT, the gas phase species must be referenced to approximately 0 K and vacuum. 


\begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
         \Delta G_{H_{2}}(T,P) &= \Big[ \Delta G_{\ce{H2}}(T,P^{o})  + RT \ln{ \frac{P_{\ce{H2}}}{P_{\ce{H2}}^{o}}} \Big]  \\ 
    \end{split}
    \label{mu_2_G}
\end{equation}
where $\Delta G_{\ce{H2}}(T,P^{o})$ is the free energy referenced to 0 K, $R$ is gas constant, $T$ is the temperature, $P_{\ce{H2}}$ is the partial pressure of \ce{H2} gas and $P_{\ce{H2}}^{o}$ is the standard pressure (1 bar).  

The standard reference state for the NASA Polynomials is 298 K; therefore, the empirical methods are approximated to 0 K using Eq.~\ref{eq:pmutt-expression} by referencing the values at 10 K, following prior work.\hl{REF-Getman-FPT-Paper}
\begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
        \Delta G(T, P^{o}) &= [G(T,P^{o}) - G(T=298 K, P^{o})] - [G(T=10 K, P^{o}) - G(T=298 K, P^{o})] \\
        \Delta G(T, P^{o}) &= [G(T,P^{o})] - [G(T=10 K, P^{o})] 
    \end{split}
    \label{eq:pmutt-expression}
\end{equation} 
where $\Delta G(T, P^{o})$ is the free energy referenced at $T = 10$~K, and $G(T,P^{o})$ is the free energy referenced at $T = 298$~K. Figures~\ref{fig:h2-pmutt-expression} and \ref{fig:h2o-pmutt-expression} show the extrapolation of the NASA Polynomial referenced to 0~K.

\subsection{Identifying spin contamination in DFT calculations}
The library was optimized at different \ce{Ni} spin states; the considered spin states for \ce{Ni} ions were singlet (no unpaired electrons) and triplet (two unpaired electrons). With the cluster initially containing four \ce{Ni} ions, the intermediate combinations were calculated (one singlet and three triplet, two singlet and two triplet, etc.). Structures that exhibited spin contamination were removed from the analysis. Comparisons between the ideal and single determinant $S^{**}2$ values were inspected. If the single determinant value deviated by more than 10\% of the ideal determinant the structure was removed from analysis.

From Table \ref{tbl:spin_contamination}, the lowest energy structure is c) three singlet, one triplet \ce{Ni} ions; however, the structure is removed from the analysis because the ideal $S^{**}2$ and single $S^{**}2$ deviate. Therefore, the lowest energy structure for this particular configuration is the e) one singlet, three triplet \ce{Ni} ions.

\subsection{Frequency Calculations}
We fix the organic linker and inorganic nodes, thereby only calculating only the \ce{Ni} cluster vibrational contributions to the free energy ($F^\text{vib}$). We ensure that the same atoms are fixed across all frequency calculations in order to correctly compare ($F^\text{vib}$). When constructing the vibrational partition function, all frequencies less than 50 cm\textsuperscript{-1} are replaced with 50 cm\textsuperscript{-1} to correct for the breakdown in the harmonic oscillator approximation for low frequency vibrational modes.\cite{Ribeiro2011} The partitions functions are computed in the pMuTT\cite{LYM2019106864} Python package to compute $E^\text{ZP}$ and $F^\text{vib}$ for all structures. A sample input file for the CP2K frequency calculations is provided in the Supporting Information. 

\newpage
\subsection{\ce{Ni-O} Coordination Numbers}
We report the \ce{Ni-O} coordination numbers for structures appearing on the phase diagram. The \ce{Ni-O} coordination numbers are determined by geometric criteria defined by the \ce{Ni-O} distance, which is between 1.9 {\AA} and 2.4 {\AA} for \ce{OH} and\ce{O} ligands. For \ce{H2O} ligands, we add an additional geometric criteria that includes the orientation of the \ce{H2O} ligand relative to the cluster. If the \ce{Ni-O} distance is below 2.4 {\AA}, the \ce{H2O} is coordinated. Additionally for \ce{H2O} ligands, if the \ce{Ni-O} distance is below 3.3 and the \ce{Ni-O} distance is less than the \ce{Ni-H} distances is coordinated to the cluster. We report the coordination numbers on a per \ce{Ni} basis, which is the average of the four \ce{Ni} ions present within the cluster.

\newpage
\subsection{Sample Input File for \ce{Ni4} Clusters - Optimization}
Below is a sample CP2K input file. If the singlet spin state was desired for all \ce{Ni(II)} atoms, UKS F and MULTIPLICITY 1 were used. Otherwise, UKS T was used with the appropriate MULTIPLICITY specified. The following sample input file is for optimizations.

%% Weighted d-PDFs
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\newpage
\section{Boltzmann Weighted d-PDFs}
We use Boltzmann weighting to combine the structural information of unique structures into a Boltzmann weighted d-PDF. We perform the Boltzmann weighting by computing the free energies of all the structures at specific \ce{H2} and \ce{H2O} chemical potentials, and then use Eq.~\ref{eq:weighted-dPDFs} to compute the Boltzmann factor ($P_{i}$) for each structure ${i}$.
\begin{equation}
    P_{i} = \frac{e^{\frac{-\Delta G_{i}}{k_{b}T}}}{\sum_{l} e^{\frac{-\Delta G_{l}}{k_{b}T}}}
    \label{eq:weighted-dPDFs}
\end{equation}
where $\Delta G$ is the free energy of structure computed according to Eq.~\hl{XXX}. We assume a temperature of $T=298 \text{K}$. Note that the Boltzmann weighting considers all the d-PDFs in our library of structures; not just the structures that are thermodynamically relevant. At specific \ce{H2} and \ce{H2O} chemical potentials, we take each d-PDF intensity between 0 {\AA} and 5 {\AA} multiplied by each Boltzmann factor for each structure and then sum all the d-PDF intensities to generate the weighted d-PDF. Key weighted Boltzmann factors are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:SI-all-dPDFs}b-d.

\newpage
\section{Phase Diagram Structure Heat Maps}
We generate heat maps further probe the potential energy surface of the \ce{Ni4} cluster, and consider the sensitivity of the different regions appearing on the phase diagram. The heat maps are created by taking the difference in free energy values (denoted $\Delta \Delta F^{(2)}$) between structure ($i$) and the low energy structure ($o$) at $\Delta \mu_{\ce{H2O}}$ and $\Delta \mu_{\ce{H2}}$ (shown in Eq.~\ref{eq:delta_delta_F}). The low energy structure is the structure that is the thermodynamic minima at specific $\mu_{\ce{H2O}}$ and $\mu_{\ce{H2}}$ values. 
\begin{equation}
    \Delta \Delta F^{(2)}_{i}(V,T,\mu_{\text{H}}, \mu_{\text{O}}, N_{\text{Ni}}) = F^{(2)}_{i}(V,T,\mu_{\text{H}}, \mu_{\text{O}}, N_{\text{Ni}}) - F^{(2)}_{o}(V,T,\mu_{\text{H}}, \mu_{\text{O}}, N_{\text{Ni}})
    \label{eq:delta_delta_F}
\end{equation}
The heat maps for all thermodynamically relevant structures and select structures are shown in Figures~S\ref{fig:SI-heatmap-green} to~S\ref{fig:SI-heatmap-maroon}.
